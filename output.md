The Left is often characterized as promoting the principles of "cultural Marxism" or "cultural socialism." |

| The "Big Pharma" lobby |  Pharmaceutical companies and related organizations that seek to influence government policy by engaging in lobbying and campaign contributions.  Big Pharma often seeks to secure government-funded research grants, procure regulations that favor their products, and promote pharmaceutical interventions. |
