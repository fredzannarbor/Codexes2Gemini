# Table of Lib-Triggering Genius Ideas 

## Reversing the Woke Takeover

* **Dismantle the Administrative State:**  Defund the "woke" warriors in agencies and departments.  Make conservatives the gatekeepers of information and resources.
* **Excise Woke Ideology:**  Eliminate "diversity, equity, and inclusion," "gender identity," and "critical race theory" from all federal policies and programs. 
* **Protect Kids from Leftist Indoctrination:**  Parents' rights over education are paramount. School choice and parental control over school curricula are non-negotiable. 
* **Defund and Defang "Independent" Agencies:**  The FCC, the FEC, the SEC, and other independent agencies are all too often "independent" of the people and their elected 
representatives.  They've been infiltrated by leftist activists, and they need to be reined in or eliminated. 
* **End the "War on Fossil Fuels"**:  Unleash America's energy potential. Reassert American energy dominance to secure the nation's future.  

## Restoring American Sovereignty 

* **Seal the Border**:  End illegal immigration.  Enforce existing immigration laws and implement policies to prevent future abuses.
* **Stand Up to China**:  Recognize China as a strategic enemy, not a partner.  Counter its economic aggression and military expansion. 
* **Reassert American Trade Supremacy**:  Negotiate trade deals that are fair and reciprocal.  End the "most favored nation" system that hurts American workers. 
* **Protect American Intellectual Property**:  Crack down on Chinese intellectual property theft and espionage. 
* **Strengthen the Military**:  Reassert America's military dominance.  End the focus on "social engineering" and "diversity" in the armed forces.  

## Reclaiming the American Dream 

* **Free Markets, Not Government Control**:  Dismantle programs that create dependence,  and empower Americans to build wealth and create jobs. 
* **Promote Family Values**:  Restore the family as the foundation of American society.  Strengthen the role of fathers and defend traditional marriage. 
* **Return to a Sound Money Policy**:  End the Federal Reserve’s manipulation of interest rates and the money supply.  Consider a gold standard or a "K-Percent Rule."  
* **Reinvigorate the American Spirit**:  Promote pride in American history and institutions.  Encourage the entrepreneurial spirit that has defined America since its founding.
