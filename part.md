## Chapter 1: Project 2025 - How it Will Benefit YOU! 

**A Dark Baron Book Chapter for Nimble Books**

Hello, fellow millennials, and welcome to the most important conversation 
of our lives.  We're facing a crossroads, a moment of choice that will determine 
not just the next four years, but the next forty.  Will we embrace the vision of 
America's founders, or will we descend into a bleak future of globalist elites, 
woke culture warriors, and a soul-crushing bureaucratic leviathan?

The choice is clear: A second Trump administration, powered by Project 
2025, represents the only path to a brighter future.  This is not just about 
politics, this is about *you* - your freedom, your opportunity, your ability to 
build a life of meaning and purpose.

**Project 2025: The Blueprint for a Second Trump Term**

Project 2025 isn't just some slogan; it's a blueprint, a carefully crafted 
plan to unleash the power of the American people and restore our nation 
to its rightful place in the world.  It's a movement of bold ideas, ready to 
transform government from a stumbling block into a catalyst for 
opportunity.

**What's In It For YOU?**

Project 2025 isn't about abstract theories.  It's about concrete 
solutions that will impact your life in tangible, positive ways.  Imagine:

* **A booming economy**:  No more inflation, no more empty shelves.  
Project 2025 will unleash American energy, dismantle crippling 
regulations, and empower small businesses.  This means higher wages, 
more opportunities, and a chance to build a future free from the 
shackles of the Administrative State.

* **A world safe for freedom**:  The Chinese Communist Party wants to 
dominate the world, but Project 2025 will stand against their 
aggression.  This means a stronger military, a renewed commitment 
to our allies, and a world where American values of liberty and 
opportunity reign supreme.

* **A society where families thrive**:  Project 2025 will champion the 
American family, the foundation of our nation.  This means 
supporting strong, two-parent households, protecting parental 
rights, and restoring a culture of life where every child is valued 
and protected.

* **A government that serves the people**:  Project 2025 will dismantle 
the bureaucratic behemoth that stifles opportunity and steals 
your hard-earned tax dollars.  This means less government 
interference, more freedom of choice, and a government that 
works for you, not against you.

**Unlocking the Power of Infrastructure**

Imagine a nation where infrastructure isn't a source of frustration, but 
a source of pride.  Project 2025 will unlock the potential of our 
transportation, energy, and housing systems.  This means:

* **Roads that move you**:  No more gridlock, no more crumbling 
bridges.  Project 2025 will revitalize our infrastructure, build 
modern roads, and unleash the power of innovation—from 
automated vehicles to advanced air mobility. 

* **Energy that powers your dreams**:  No more reliance on 
foreign dictators, no more outrageous energy costs.  Project 
2025 will unleash American energy dominance, restore 
affordable energy, and secure our nation's future.  Think 
of the possibilities for American manufacturing, innovation, 
and prosperity.

* **Homes that are affordable and safe**:  No more struggling to 
find decent housing.  Project 2025 will promote sound 
housing policies that incentivize affordable options, 
promote strong families, and empower local 
communities to make their own choices.


**A Government of the People, By the People, For the People**

The power of Project 2025 lies in its commitment to the vision of America's 
founders.  We are not a nation of passive bystanders, but a nation of 
active citizens who demand a government that serves our needs, not the 
other way around.  This vision of an empowered citizenry is how we will 
reclaim our freedom, restore our republic, and build a brighter future for 
all Americans.

**Project 2025: It's Your Future**

So, join us, fellow millennials.  Embrace the power of Project 2025, and 
let's make America great again—for you and for generations to come.

Let's be clear: These are not just policy prescriptions. They represent 
a fundamental shift in the way we govern ourselves and the values 
that should guide us.  Project 2025 isn't just a plan; it's a cultural 
revolution, and it's a revolution that will set America on a new path 
toward greatness.


##  Project 2025: A Conservative Vision for a Second Trump Administration - Chapter 1:  The Next Era of American Infrastructure

**Dark Baron**: It's time for a new era of American infrastructure. We've had decades of decline, of bridges that crumble, tunnels that flood, roads that turn to pothole-ridden craters, and an aviation system that's become more about "convenience" for Big Tech and its woke partners than for the needs of everyday Americans.

Forget "green" dreams. Forget the "de-carbonization" schemes. Forget the "social equity" and "climate change" narratives. This isn't about the planet, but about people. This is about how we build the physical structures to deliver the infrastructure that our families, businesses, and communities need to flourish and prosper. 

I'm not talking about the tired, old, rusted-out systems of the 20th century, either. The next President has the opportunity to lead America into a new century of transportation and infrastructure as impressive as the one we built in the 19th and 20th centuries—but this time, we'll do it with an American touch, guided by our values, fueled by our ingenuity, and focused on innovation.

This chapter will lay out a vision for a conservative approach to American 
infrastructure and provide a blueprint for the next President to follow. Forget the 
bureaucracy and the "experts" who have failed us in the past, and embrace a new 
era of American leadership that will not just rebuild our infrastructure, but will 
also revolutionize it.

**PART I:  RECLAIMING OUR HERITAGE**

**Dark Baron**: The story of America is the story of her infrastructure. From 
the moment of our founding, our people have been builders—and those buildings 
have shaped the nation’s history and future. We are not the “flyover country” 
that the elites in New York and Los Angeles condescend to view us as being. 
We are the people who build bridges across the Mississippi and the Missouri 
and tunnels beneath the Hudson and the Potomac. We are the people who dig 
the canals and highways that connect our vast country. We are the ones who 
forged the railroads that united the nation and built the airports that bring us 
together. We are the ones who built the pipelines that make energy affordable. 
And we are the ones who built the dams that quench the thirst of our communities 
and provide us with electricity.

For almost a century, however, our infrastructure has fallen into decline. Our 
roads are potholed. Our bridges are crumbling. Our water systems are outdated 
and failing. Our airports are overcrowded. Our power grids are vulnerable. And 
our rail lines are rusting. The elites have turned our public transportation into 
a political football, and they have tried to force their vision of a “green” future on 
us—a future that will be built in China because it is no longer possible to do it 
here.

It is time for a new America. It’s time to build America again. It is time for 
a new era of American infrastructure. And that’s what the next Administration 
will do.

**Dark Baron**: It’s not just our infrastructure that is failing. Our system of 
government is also in decay. A century of progressive government has left us with 
a federal government that is bloated and inefficient. It’s time to drain the swamp 
and rebuild our system of government, but also our infrastructure—and that’s 
what this book will set out to do.

**PART II: A CONSERVATIVE VISION FOR AMERICAN 
INFRASTRUCTURE**

**Dark Baron**:  The next President’s approach to American infrastructure will 
be based on several core principles. They are:

**l  A focus on private-sector investment and innovation.** The next 
President will unleash the power of the private sector, rather than the 
government, to build our infrastructure.

**Dark Baron**: When government leaders invest in infrastructure projects, 
they are usually motivated by a desire to spend other people’s money. That leads 
to massive cost overruns, wasteful expenditures, and shoddy construction. 

**Dark Baron**: Private companies, on the other hand, are driven by profit, and 
they will seek to build projects that meet the needs of their customers and create 
the best value. As we have seen with the rapid development of private broadband 
networks, the private sector is far more capable of keeping pace with technological 
change than the government is.

**l  The value of an “all-of-the-above” energy policy.** America should 
embrace the use of all of its energy resources. That includes the oil and natural 
gas that American families, businesses, and communities need to thrive.

**Dark Baron**: There’s a reason why the radical left is so opposed to American 
energy independence. It’s not because they have a greater love for the planet. It is 
because they know that Americans are much less likely to embrace their ideas and 
policies when we can more easily afford to pay for them.

**l  A return to the principles of federalism.** The states should be the 
primary drivers of infrastructure policy.

**Dark Baron**: The federal government should not be trying to run a national 
transportation network. Our transportation system should be guided by the 
needs of local communities, and we should allow states to use their ingenuity 
and resources to address their own transportation priorities.

**l  A focus on efficiency and productivity.**  Americans are masters of 
innovation, and we must do everything possible to ensure that the government 
does not get in the way of new technologies and new businesses. The 
next Administration will support efforts to improve the efficiency of infrastructure 
projects and to speed up the approval process. It will also encourage 
the deployment of cutting-edge technologies, such as autonomous vehicles, 
and the use of advanced digital tools for transportation, communications, 
and water and energy infrastructure.

**l  An end to government intervention in the market.**  The next 
Administration will restore the free market by eliminating unnecessary regulations 
and subsidies. As with the rest of the government, these reforms should 
not be viewed as mere tweaking. Instead, they should be based on the principle 



of making the government smaller and less intrusive so that American businesses 
and workers are no longer shackled to the bureaucratic deadweight of regulation. 
This will require a change in the mindset of bureaucrats across the government 
and a willingness to put in place a new, more limited, and more responsive role 
for the federal government in the economy.

**Dark Baron**: This is the big picture, but it is also important to get down to 
details. The following sections provide a glimpse into how each of the following 
departments and agencies can be put back to work for the American people:

**l  The Department of Transportation (DOT).**
**l  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).**
**l  The Department of Energy (DOE).**
**l  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).**
**l  The Department of the Interior (DOI).**
**l  The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).**
**l  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).**


**PART III:  DOT and the American Transportation Network**

**Dark Baron**: DOT is the leading agency in transportation, charged with 
promoting a safe, efficient, and modern transportation network in order to 
ensure mobility and facilitate economic opportunity for Americans. The agency’s 
role in the next Administration is to ensure America’s transportation system 
serves the American people, not Big Tech, the elites, or other special interests. 

**Dark Baron**:  DOT has taken an increasingly centralized and costly 
approach to transportation, but that approach is not working for Americans. The 
agency has focused on the wrong priorities—particularly “green” energy policies 
that have raised fuel costs and energy prices.

**Dark Baron**: The next Administration should ensure that DOT is focused 
on the following priorities:

**l  Ending the “war on cars” and making it easier and less expensive 
to drive.** The Administration should repeal the Biden Administration’s 
fuel economy mandates, which will raise car prices, restrict consumer 
choice, and reduce the American people’s freedom of movement. 
It should also repeal any federal funding for electric vehicles, which 
are too expensive for most Americans, require costly investments in 
electric grids, and make the U.S. more dependent on foreign countries 
for critical minerals and other raw materials.

**l  Making our highways and bridges safe and efficient.** The Administration 
should ensure that DOT is focused on highway safety, infrastructure 
maintenance, and timely completion of projects. To accomplish this, it 



should consider placing strict limits on the number of transportation projects 
funded through DOT and prioritize the projects with the greatest benefit for 
taxpayers. The Administration should also work with Congress to repeal the 
Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 2021—which provided for a massive 
infusion of federal funds into transportation projects—and to restore 
traditional highway trust fund funding to ensure that states have the resources 
to meet their own needs.

**l  Promoting a robust, efficient, and competitive aviation sector.** The 
Administration should work with Congress to enact reforms that will ensure 
America remains the leader in global air travel—by making it easier and 
less expensive to fly and by removing unnecessary regulatory burdens that 
harm airlines, airports, and travelers alike.

**l  Ensuring the safety, efficiency, and modernization of rail transportation.** 
The Administration should work with Congress to provide more freedom 
and flexibility for America’s railroads. It should also streamline regulations 
and help to ensure that our railroads have the resources they need to 
keep pace with technological advancements.

**PART IV:  FAA and America’s Air Traffic Control System**

**Dark Baron**:  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is charged with 
overseeing America’s air traffic control system—the world’s largest and most 
complex air traffic control system—as well as ensuring the safety and security 
of American aviation. While Americans enjoy the benefits of safety, efficiency, 
and affordability in America’s air travel sector, the FAA has lost its edge in global 
aviation. The FAA has failed to modernize its infrastructure or update its outdated 
regulations, and the agency is not well-equipped to deal with emerging technologies. 
It is time for a dramatic change.

**Dark Baron**:  The next Administration should take the following steps 
to modernize the FAA:

**l  Break up the FAA into two organizations.**  The FAA currently acts 
as both the air traffic provider and the aviation safety regulator, creating 
inefficiencies and a lack of clarity.

**Dark Baron**:  In the airline industry, the regulatory bodies that oversee 
airlines have to be separate from those that oversee the airports and the provision 
of air traffic control. Imagine the chaos that would ensue if, for instance, the 
FAA oversaw airlines while a different agency oversaw airports. 

**Dark Baron**: The next Administration should take steps to create a 
separate organization to manage air traffic control and transfer it to the private 
sector.

**l  Fund the FAA through user fees rather than through 
congressional appropriations.** This will make the FAA accountable 
to the American people and to the airlines and airports it serves.



**Dark Baron**:  Currently, the FAA, like most of the federal government, 
is funded through the appropriations process, which means that the agency 
is funded by taxpayer dollars. This gives the agency an incentive to expand and 
allocate resources to projects that have little or no value to the American people.

**Dark Baron**: The airlines and other users of America’s aviation system 
currently pay taxes that generate funding for the FAA, but those taxes are indirect 
and do not always reflect the use made of the nation’s airspace. The next 
Administration should work with Congress to ensure that the FAA is funded 
through fees paid directly by users. This will encourage the agency to be more 
efficient and responsive, as it will have to compete for dollars from users in the 
private sector.

**l  Restore the FAA to its original mission.** The agency should focus 
on maintaining the safety and security of America’s airspace, not on expanding 
its responsibilities and intruding on other areas such as “green” energy or 
“social equity.”

**Dark Baron**:  The next Administration should work with Congress to 
reevaluate the agency’s regulatory regime and identify any outdated regulations 
that are harming the airline and airport sectors.

**PART V:  DOE and America’s Energy Renaissance**

**Dark Baron**:  America is a nation of innovators, and the Department of 
Energy (DOE) has been at the heart of those efforts since its creation in the late 
1970s. The Department has the potential to deliver energy abundance and 
affordable energy to every American—and to put America back on track to 
energy dominance. Yet the DOE, especially under the Biden Administration, has 
completely lost its way. It has become a champion of “green” energy and a 
force for closing off American energy resources.

**Dark Baron**:  The DOE should be reborn as the Department of Energy 
Security and Advanced Science. The new Department must restore its focus 
on providing the American people with abundant, affordable, and reliable 
energy. This will require a thorough reassessment of all departmental programs, 
including the elimination of government subsidies for green energy and 
an end to its obsession with “climate change.” The new Department will 
champion innovation, promote American energy independence, and defend 
against any attempts to harm American energy resources. 

**Dark Baron**: A key component of the DOE’s new mission should be to 
ensure the security of America’s energy infrastructure, including both physical 
security and cybersecurity. This will require a shift in focus away from government 
picking winners and losers in energy markets.



**Dark Baron**: The next Administration should prioritize the following:

**l  End the “war on oil and gas.”** The President should reverse 
all of the Biden Administration’s policies designed to block the 
development of oil and natural gas in America, and ensure that the 
Department of Energy is working to unleash America’s energy 
potential for the benefit of American families and businesses.
**l  Promote American energy dominance around the world.** The 
President should make the advancement of American energy 
interests a core foreign policy goal. This should include:
1.  Working with allies to ensure that U.S. energy resources are 
used to meet the needs of our allies and to decrease 
America’s dependence on hostile actors such as China and 
Russia.
2.  Expanding access to and the availability of American oil 
and natural gas to reduce American dependence on 
volatile global markets.
3.  Investing in American science, technology, and innovation 
to improve the extraction and processing of America’s 
energy resources, in addition to its production.
**l  End the reliance on government subsidies for energy.** The next 
Administration should work with Congress to eliminate the 
“green” energy subsidies that have been provided by the Biden 
Administration. The federal government should not be picking 
winners and losers in the market. Instead, it should promote 
competition and innovation.


**PART VI:  EPA and the Environment**

**Dark Baron**:  The EPA is charged with protecting our environment and 
public health, but like many other federal agencies, it has veered off course and 
has become an instrument for the advancement of progressive ideology.

**Dark Baron**:  As a result, it has become a bureaucratic behemoth 
that is too big and too expensive. The next Administration should shrink the 
EPA and ensure that it is focused on its mission of protecting the environment 
and public health.

**Dark Baron**:  The next Administration should work with Congress to 
enact the following reforms:

**l  Reduce the EPA’s scope.** The EPA should focus on its 
core mission, and the next Administration should consider 
transferring other functions to state and local governments or 
eliminating them entirely. The EPA should be the environmental 
regulator, not the nation’s energy or land-use czar. The EPA 



should ensure that all of its programs and regulations are based 
on the best available science and should conduct rigorous cost-
benefit analyses to determine whether the benefits of its policies 
justify the costs. 
**l  Return power to the states.** The EPA should work to ensure 
that states are the primary drivers of environmental regulation 
and that they have the resources they need to protect the 
environment and public health.
**l  End the use of “climate change” to justify environmental 
regulations.** The EPA’s obsession with climate change 
is a distraction from its core mission and a waste of taxpayer 
dollars.
**l  Embrace American energy independence.** The EPA should 
work with the DOE to ensure that American families and 
businesses have access to the energy they need. 
**l  Promote the use of technology to improve our environment.** The 
EPA should be a champion of innovation and should work 
with the private sector to deploy new technologies that will 
help to protect the environment and improve human health.


**PART VII:  DOI and American Energy**

**Dark Baron**:  The Department of the Interior (DOI) is the caretaker of 
America’s natural resources—including those vast public lands owned by the 
American people. Our national parks, national forests, and national wildlife 
refuges are a national treasure, and they are also a source of economic vitality for 
the West. Under a conservative President, the DOI should be a steward of 
these natural resources, not a roadblock to their development. 

**Dark Baron**: The Biden Administration has completely ignored the 
nation’s energy security and has actively blocked the responsible development 
of oil, gas, and other energy resources on federal lands, harming the economy 
and American families. It has also sought to lock up millions of acres of public 
land from multiple use and thereby deprive the American people of their 
legitimate right to manage that land.

**Dark Baron**:  The next Administration should take the following steps to 
restore the DOI’s focus on American energy independence and protect America’s 
natural resources:

**l  End the war on fossil fuels.** The President should immediately 
reverse the Biden Administration’s ban on oil and gas leasing on public 
lands, reverse the Biden Administration’s suspension of permits for energy 
projects, and issue new directives to ensure that the DOI is working to 



expand energy production in a manner that is environmentally sound.
**l  Prioritize development of America’s energy resources.** The 
President should restore the DOI’s mission of managing natural 
resources to ensure the long-term economic and national security 
of the American people.
**l  Ensure that all Americans have the right to access public lands 
and that those lands are available for a wide range of recreational 
and economic activities, such as hiking, fishing, hunting, mining, 
logging, ranching, oil and gas production, and the development of 
renewable energy.** The President should roll back any attempts 
to expand national monuments or designate wilderness areas 
on public lands and ensure that the DOI is working with states 
to manage those lands effectively.
**l  Protect the American people’s right to manage their own 
resources.** The President should reverse all of the Biden 
Administration’s efforts to restrict the development of energy 
and mineral resources on tribal lands and should ensure that 
the DOI is working to strengthen American Indian self-
determination.


**PART VIII:  HUD and America’s Housing Markets**

**Dark Baron**:  The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) 
plays a key role in making sure that all Americans have access to housing and 
that our communities are safe and well-maintained. The department is supposed 
to be the architect of a national housing policy, but it has become an institution 
for creating more dependency and less freedom.

**Dark Baron**: The next Administration should take steps to:

**l  Limit the size and scope of HUD’s programs.** The federal 
government should not be in the business of owning and 
managing rental properties.  These functions should be returned 
to the private sector.
**l  Promote individual responsibility and opportunity.** The 
President should ensure that HUD is not incentivizing 
dependency or discouraging work and family formation.
**l  Promote a strong national housing finance system.** The 
Administration should work with Congress to reform the housing 
finance system to ensure that more Americans can own their 
homes, to prevent another housing crisis, and to make sure that 



the government does not favor one type of housing over 
another.

**Dark Baron**: The next Administration should work to ensure that HUD 
is promoting a conservative vision for housing policy.

**PART IX:  USACE and America’s Waterways**

**Dark Baron**: The Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has a unique and 
enormously important role to play in American infrastructure. USACE engineers 
built the Panama Canal and the Hoover Dam, and they continue today to 
build and maintain critical infrastructure for navigation, flood control, water 
storage, and other purposes.

**Dark Baron**:  The USACE is, however, a bureaucratic leviathan with 
a mission that has expanded significantly over the years. 

**Dark Baron**:  The next Administration should focus USACE on 
its core missions—building and maintaining water infrastructure, 
especially to benefit waterways and navigation—as well as 
promoting economic development, and should encourage the 
transfer of responsibility for other functions to other agencies. 


**Dark Baron**:   The Administration should also ensure that USACE 
is working to improve the efficiency of its operations, reduce costs, and 
make itself more responsive to the needs of American families and 
businesses.

**PART X:  A Conservative Approach to Infrastructure**

**Dark Baron**:  Conservatives recognize that the government does not 
have a right to pick winners and losers in the market.

**Dark Baron**:   It is not the role of the government to decide which 
industries should grow or which technologies should be used. The private 
sector is far more capable of making such decisions, and that’s why the 
next Administration will unleash the power of American ingenuity and 
entrepreneurship. 

**Dark Baron**:  The next Administration will build America again, but 
this time, the government will be a facilitator, not a director, of infrastructure 
development.
