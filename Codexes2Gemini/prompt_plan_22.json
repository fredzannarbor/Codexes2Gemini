{"multiplan": [{"name": "forrestal", "context": "A fire on board the USS Forrestal in 1967 resulted in the deaths of 116 crew members and injuries to 161 others. The fire was started by a chain of events that began at 1051 local time on 29 July 1967.\n\nThe FORKESTAL was launching air strikes against North Vietma and had been since 25 July. On 12 A-4, 12 F-4, and 3 A-6 aircraft were on the deck ready for a launch when an 2-4, 110 crashed into the ship, causing a large fire.\n\nA rocket ignited a fire on the USS Forrestal's flight deck, which spread to other aircraft and caused several explosions. Many were injured and some killed.\n\nPoor and out-dated doctrinal and technical documentation of ordnance and aircraft equipment and procedures resulted in an accidental rocket firing, starting a fire on the FORRESTAL that killed 134 personnel.\n\nCommanding Officer of Fighter Squadron ELEVEN and Lieutenant of Weapons Branch Officer were both found to have poor judgment and supervisory deficiencies, although no specific blame in connection with the fire was attributed to either of them. The investigation recommended that no disciplinary or administrative action be taken with regard to any persons attached to the FORRESTAL or Carrier Air Wing SEVENTEEN as a result of the fire.\n\nA ZUNI rocket was inadvertently fired from an F-4 aircraft and struck the external fuel tank of an A-4 aircraft, causing a raging fire. It is highly improbable that the rocket would have fired with the resulting damage had the pigtails not been connected to the launcher receptacle until the aircraft was ready for takeoff, as required by pertinent regulations.\n\nThe standard operating procedures of VF-11 were vague and undocumented, and the Weapons Coordination Board stated that the NAVWEPS OP 2210, which forbids the arming of launcher armament until \"just prior to takeoff,\" is to be interpreted in favor of safety.\n\nThe Board found that the commanding officer played a role in the fire that killed 134 people on the USS Forrestal, and that this fact cannot be ignored.\n\nThe Commanding Officer is responsible for everything that goes on in his ship, but because of the ship's size and complexity, he can only exercise this responsibility indirectly. In the case of the rocket accident on the USS Forrestal, the Commanding Officer had issued regulations requiring \"positive compliance\" with safety regulations, but he did not follow up to ensure that these regulations were being followed. This negligence contributed to the accident.\n\nThe commanding officer is responsible for the rocket firing incident because he did not enforce safety regulations.\n\nThe FORRESTAL was found to be unsatisfactory in damage control readiness by the INSGENLANTFLT on May 10, 1967. The report does not reveal whether or not this condition still prevailed on July 29, 1967. Additionally, the Report does not list as a Finding of Fact any attempts to maneuver the ship.\n\nCOMNAVAIRLANT proposes a test manning for the USS AMERICA, in order to alleviate heavy drains on personnel resources - a proposal which requires additional information. The Commander in Chief U. S. Atlantic Fleet concurs and requests more information. Additionally, they recommend the feasibility of designing a single test set be investigated, in order to provide a comprehensive test of the circuitry and limit the possibility of attaching the rocket harness to the LAU 10/A Launchers with any form of stray voltage present in the circuit. Lastly, they suggest a study be initiated to determine the feasibility of designing a single size safety pin for all Navy aircraft - a type of safetying method which would preclude the possibility of inserting a safety pin into a component and not actually rendering the component safe.\n\nThe Board of Investigation found that the fire aboard the USS Forrestal on 29 July 1967 was caused by inadequate instructions and technical publications, but responsibility for the deaths and injuries could not be ascribed to any one party.\n\nThe board of investigation has recommended that a placard be published giving withdrawal distance, fire fighting/withdrawal time and explosive ignition time for each type of ordnance. This placard should be readily available at control points such as Flight Deck Control, Primary-fly, the Bridge, Damage Control Central, Central Control and Aviation Ordnance Control Station.\n\nThe following is a declassified statement from the Department of Defense regarding a fire that occurred on board the USS Forrestal. The statement includes findings of fact, opinions, recommendations, lessons learned, and general index volumes relating to the incident.\n\nThis document contains a list of witnesses and persons who submitted statements related to the fire on the USS Forrestal, as well as the arguments submitted by counsel on behalf of their parties.\n\nThe hoses at fire stations 14, 18, and 20 were engulfed in flames and couldn't be used at the outset of the fire. The hoses at fire stations 15 and 17 were not led out or charged and were engulfed in flames by the second explosion. The configuration of the second deck HCFF stations prevents the manning crew from communicating with the crews on the hangar or flight deck.\n\n-The Board of Investigation tested HCFF stations on the flight deck for automatic operation and found that they varied in time required to generate good foam from 30 seconds to 4 minutes -Of the 525 OBAs on hand, 450 were new and in good material condition -Complaints were received that some OBAs were in poor material condition -The damage control message chits were inadvertently destroyed, hampering the Board's ability to reconstruct a true picture of the damage control and fire fighting efforts -Only two men were killed during the fire fighting operations after major explosions had subsided\n\n-The ship caught fire on July 29 due to inexperienced personnel actuating divisional doors between hangar bays 2 and 3. -One man took approximately one hour to jettison 750 gallons of liquid oxygen through a single one inch, 16 foot length hose. -There is no emergency dump capability installed in FORRESTAL's liquid oxygen systems. -The 1MC ship's announcing system was ineffective in the hangar deck areas. -Planning and drill for flight deck fire fighting had concentrated chiefly on the landing areas of the flight deck, with lesser emphasis elsewhere. -The escalator between 2nd and 02 decks (2-187-2-1) acted as a reverse stack feeding smoke downward to the second deck. -Many sought to assist in fire fighting but were unable to identify the on-scene leader. -A minor list of 2.5 degrees to port was caused by shrapnel holes in the trans om and on the port side aft near and at the waterline which which flooded voids 8-244-2-V.\n\n134 people died or went missing in the fire and explosions on the USS Forrestal on July 29, 1967. 116 of the 134 have been positively identified. The remaining 18 are presumed dead.\n\nAt least 349 FORRESTAL personnel were blasted, knocked, jumped, or fell into the water on 29 July 1967 and were subsequently recovered. Thirteen of these have been identified.\n\n87 personnel were injured and 8 were killed in the fire and explosions on the USS Enterprise.\n\nThe following personnel are presumed dead, trapped in their compartments: ABH2, AME2, I, AQF3, 3-74, PRAN, F-74 A., Div., SN, F-74 AN, /F-11 HEAN, F-74 SN 402, -1-65, \"F-11 J-L AL3. The causes of death are unknown but are presumed to be due to the extreme injuries or burns sustained.\n\nMultiple sailors were killed in the explosion and fire on the USS Enterprise flight deck, with the cause of death unknown for some. It is presumed that some were trapped in compartments.\n\n03-231-0-L, 03-236-0-L, and 7., ATR3 all died from third degree burns over their entire bodies. The cause of death for 03-236-0-L is unknown. AE3, 4-244-0-A Div., and B-b. are all redacted. All deaths are presumed to be due to being trapped in a compartment.\n\n13 men were killed in the attack on the USS Oriskany. Three men were seen in their compartments after the first bomb exploded, and one was seen in the AMD Para-loft. One man was fighting fires by Salt Water Station #15 when he was forced down an external ladder and caught fire. He threw himself overboard to extinguish the flames and was recovered by the Oriskany but later died. One man was seen near Aft fuel and also went down the external ladder with injuries. He was seen in the water but it is not known if he was recovered.\n\nSurvived 1st explosion, but was last seen in vicinity of elevator 3 and 4 prior to second explosion. Presumed trapped in compartment.\n\nSeventeen men were killed in the fire on the USS Forrestal on July 29, 1967. All of the men were either burned or had multiple extreme injuries. The cause of death for some is unknown.\n\n-Multiple people died from unknown causes, with multiple extreme injuries and/or third degree burns -Some were presumed trapped in compartments -Some were last seen in certain areas before presumed death\n\nMultiple people were severely injured or killed in the fire, with most presumed to be trapped in compartments that were engulfed in flames. Many had third-degree burns over 70-80% of their bodies.\n\nMultiple injuries from fire on USS Forrestal. Second and third degree burns on 80% of body. Presumed trapped in compartment.\n\nThe cost of voyage repairs after the fire on the USS Forrestal was $45,000. The preliminary estimate for repairing the structural damage is $16,000,000. 21 aircraft were destroyed and 40 were damaged. The estimated value of ordnance destroyed or jettisoned is $1,950,000. The estimated value of supplies and equipage jettisoned or damaged beyond repair is $3,150,000. The estimated cost of repair of equipage damaged is $225,000. The replacement cost for the Dual Purpose Battery and associated fire control equipment is $6,210,000.\n\nThe fire on the USS Forrestal was caused by the accidental firing of one ZUNI rocket from an F-4B. The proximate cause of the accident was material failures of aircraft and armament components, and poor and outdated doctrinal and technical documentation.\n\n-The CA42282 pylon electrical disconnect is of defective design in that it is susceptible to shorting by moisture. -The Naval Air Systems Command erred in: a. Changing the wiring of the TER-7 mod -527 so that the safety switch is shorted to ground in the \"SAFE\" position rather than open as in models -505 and -521. b. Issuing the TER-7 mod -527 to the fleet without promulgating a complete description of the equipment and procedures for conducting circuit testing and checking based on the new circuitry. C. Changing direction of throw of the HOME-STEP switch in the TER-7 mod -527 from that of the TER-7 mod -505 and -521. -The electrical safety pin for the TER-7 is poorly designed in that the ordnance pins which are used in the AERO-7 Sparrow Launcher and the LAU-17/A pylon, and which will not reliably actuate the TER-7 safety switch, can be mistakenly inserted in the TER-7 pylon. -The existues of ordnanas safety ins which are physically interchangeable but functionally interchangeable ere bec a potentially dangerous situation.\n\nThe LAU-10/1 shorting device is an inherently dangerous piece of equipment which can lead to inadvertent firing of rockets.\n\n-The ordnancemen of VF-11 should have been better informed of the decisions made at the 29 June 1967 Weapons Coordination Board meeting, and should have followed procedures more closely. -LTJG-6 failed to keep his commanding officer properly informed of the meeting and its possible impact on squadron ordnance operations. -CDH- also failed to keep himself adequately informed of the details relating to the meeting and its possible impact on squadron ordnance operations.\n\nVF-11 were generally competent as individuals but were poorly organized and instructed. That official documentation as to when and where to conduct stray voltage checks for IAU-10/As is ambiguous and inadequate. That documentation as to specifically how to conduct stray voltage checks for the F-4B/TER-7/LAU-10/A weapons system is inadequate. That although there were no directives or guidance to prohibit it, leading VF-11 ordnance personnel exercised poor judgment in allowing stray voltage checks and plugging in rockets before the aircraft's electrical system had stabilized after starting, i.e., before both engines were started and the aircraft was switched to internal electrical power.\n\n-LCDR 6-6 failed to see the ZUNI covers on the port side -CO, VF-11, displayed poor judgment in eliminating the requirement for an ordnance safety petty officer during stray voltage check and rocket plug-in while aircraft were spotted in the pack. -Ordnancemen should not conduct stray voltage checks or plug in rockets without the pilot's specific knowledge. -NATOPS procedures are deficient in that they do not require that the pilot check the position of the Armament Override Switch during pre-starting cockpit check. -The personnel assigned to the Weapons Branch of VF-11 were adequate in both numbers and experience.\n\nThe accident was not due to a lack of personnel or experience level. VF-11 had sufficient time and opportunity to develop operational proficiency in the F-4. The squadron's administrative and organizational progress is unimpressive. The loose ordnance organization and poor procedures of VF-11 as described in previous statements of opinion were not known to the Air Wing Commander, the Air Wing Ordnance Officer, the Ship's Operations Officer or CO, FORRESTAL. Inconsistencies and improper procedures evident in VF-11 ordnance operations should have been discerned by ship and air wing personnel and corrected. That, at least a part of the poor organization and procedures, mentioned above, and the failure to uncover them can be attributed to the short period during which the squadron had been operating on Yankee Station. That despite the short interval between the ship's overhaul and deployment to WESTPAC and despite the relatively short period since commissioning of CWW-17, FORRESTAL arrived on Yankee Station with a comparatively high degree of personnel and material readiness. Navy personnel policies should have permitted the stabilization of the ship's personnel at the beginning of refresher training and thus have enabled FORRESTAL to retain, for deployment, those personnel who received refresher training. FORRESTAL's material readiness for fire fighting and damage control were at acceptable standards at the time of the fire. The magnitude of the fire and the resultant heavy damage was due to the concentration on the flight deck of aircraft loaded with aviation ordnance stores and huge quantities of aviation fuel; a condition characteristic of present day combat carrier operations. With existing installed fire fighting equipment, the fire could not have been extinguished prior to the explosion of major\n\n57. Firefighting efforts were underway on the flight deck at the time of the first explosion. 56. Firefighting was suspended during the major explosions (approximately five minutes) and resumed after they subsided. 59. The design and operating procedures of current firefighting equipment is inadequate to the needs generated by modern combat operations. 112 - 60. Methods and devices must be developed to rapidly jettison or drain large quantities of fuel. 61. Jettisoning ordnance stores and aircraft was difficult. 62. The fire might have been confined to a few aircraft had proper equipment and techniques been available. 63. The concentration of exposed ordnance stores on the hangar and flight decks creates a dangerous situation.\n\n-There were not enough fire stations on the second deck to provide adequate protection against fire. -Many personnel who were not familiar with damage control procedures improperly initiated actions, such as opening and closing hangar bay doors without informing Damage Control Central. -The concentration of armed aircraft on the flight deck generated high hazard conditions for the flight deck as well as for the 03, 02, 01 and hangar deck areas beneath. -The cook-off time of ordnance stores in use was not available to FORRESTAL, and cook-off of installed ordnance stores occurred earlier than expected, causing injury and loss of life. -The HCFF hose stations in FORRESTAL lack standard configuration and invite confusion, and therefore constitute a potentially hazardous situation. -Key personnel of the damage control organization, including key repair party members, were not distinctively marked and could not be readily identified. -FORRESTAL's allowance of OBA cannisters and fog foam was sufficient to support only the initial fire fighting efforts, and without the continuing replenishment of OBA cannisters and fog foam from assisting ships, FORRESTAL would probably not have been able to extinguish the fire.\n\nThe fire on the USS Forrestal was started by an electrical malfunction, and rapidly spread due to the presence of flammable materials and the lack of effective fire-fighting measures. The weather was not a factor, but the high ambient temperature may have contributed to the fire's spread.\n\n-That some hatches and doors along casualty routes for injured personnel remained open during condition ZEBRA to enhance the movement of injured personnel. -That the status and loading of each magazine in the ship is vital information for effective damage control. -That records were not properly maintained and preserved in Central Control and Damage Control Central relating to significant events that occurred during the casualty. -That air wing personnel require considerably more basic training in fire fighting and damage control. -That the Commanding Officer FORRESTAL consistently demonstrated a personal interest in the material condition and training of his ship's company in fire fighting and damage control.\n\n94. Commander performed satisfactorily as Air Officer and is not to blame for the fire. 95. Lieutenant Commander performed satisfactorily as Hongar Deck Officer before and after the fire, but was not on board during the fire and is not to blame. 96. Lieutenant performed satisfactorily as Flight Deck Officer and is not to blame. 97. Chief Warrant Officer performed satisfactorily as Fire Marshall and is not to blame. 98. Warrant Officer performed satisfactorily as Air Ordnance Gunner and is not to blame. 99. Commander Jr. performed satisfactorily as Commander of CVW-17 and is not to blame. 100. Lieutenant Commander performed satisfactorily as pilot of VF-11 aircraft #110 and is not to blame. 101. Overall inherent weaknesses in development and documentation of ordnance operations, procedures, and safety measures caused the CVW Ordnance Officer to be unable to carry out all of his responsibilities relating to the fire, but he is not to blame.\n\nNo blame attaches to anyone in connection with the fire that occurred in FORRESTAL on 29 July 1967.\n\n109. That 40% satisfactorily performed his duties as Aviation ordnance 29 July 1967. 110. That AOAA satisfactorily performed his assigned duties as stray voltage chocker in accordance with instructions given him and that no blame attaches to AON in connection with the fire that occurred in FORRESTAL on 29 July 1967. 111. That the major cause of injuries were wounds caused by shrapnel, flying objects and burns. 112. That the major causes of death were concussions from the bombs, suffocation, burns, and wounds caused by shrapnel and flying debris. 113. That all personnel injured during the fire on board FORRESTAL on 29 July 1967 were injured in the line of duty and not due to their own misconduct. 114. That the deaths and injuries resulting from the fire aboard FORRESTIL on 29 July 1967 were not caused by the intent of any person or persons in the naval service or connected therewith, 115. That the deaths and injuries resulting from the fire aboard FORRESTAL on 29 July 1967 were not caused by the intent, fault, negligence, or efficiency of any person or persons embarked in FORRESTIL. 116. B.S by: 20 S > RECOMMENDATIONS 1. That the LAU-10/A launcher not be used on F-4 aircraft until: A redesigned shorting device is available. b. Deficiencies in Ch42282 pylon electrical disconnect are corrected. c. Wiring of the -527 TER safety switch is corrected. d. Adequate procedures are promulgated to check for stray voltage in the rocket firing circuits of the F-4. a. 2. That the LAU-10/4 be provided, as a matter of urgency, with a shorting device which acts positively, assuring that it can be placed only in \"safe\" or \"arm\" with no intermediate positions. 3. That the above LAU-10/A shorting device be so designed that it does not interfere with the LAU-10/A suspension lug. 4. That\n\n1. Change wiring of safety switch in -527 TER so that it opens firing circuit in \"SAFE\" position. 2. Incorporate stray voltage test receptacle in TER-7. 3. Modify procedures for conducting firing circuit continuity checks on TER-7 MOD-527. 4. Review all aircraft/rocket systems for use and correct procedures and documentation as necessary.\n\n-Develop procedures and safety precautions with experts, and distribute to all relevant commands -If procedures are not adequate for combat situations, initiate immediate recommendations for modification to appropriate higher authority -Establish a series of publications on aircraft operation and technical procedures, to be kept under continual review and updated frequently\n\nDevelop standardized procedure for preparing and documenting all operational and technical procedures not adequately covered by other official publications.\n\n-Stay with unit -Inform pilot of any aircraft touching -Minimize detachment of trained personnel before deployment -Study for new firefighting equipment/procedures -Increase response and effectiveness of existing carrier fire fighting systems\n\n-Hose stations should be of a standard configuration, with distinctive markings, isolated from other fittings which might be confusing. -The stations' location should be highly visible and unmistakably identifiable from the flight and hangar deck by a standard method which readily attracts attention and is not obscured by aircraft spotted nearby. -Key personnel should be issued and wear more distinctive badge/hat/brassard which is readily discernible to promote better on-the-scene control and identification. -Central Control should maintain daily records as to the status and loading of each magazine. -When practicable, fire lanes should be created in the pack by leaving space between aircraft in order to assist in isolating fires and to allow hoses and equipment to be moved with greater facility.\n\n-A list of cook-off times for ordnance should be posted at fire fighting stations and on fire fighting equipment. -Each item of ordnance should be labeled with its cook-off time. -Equipment and procedures should be developed to prevent ordnance cook-off while fire fighting is in progress. -Consideration should be given in future carrier modification and new designs to extending the flight deck over the stern to prevent burning fuel from engulfing the fantail. -Consideration should be given to providing all appropriate compartments with alternate escape exits. -Remotely actuated, high capacity sprinkler systems should be considered for installation to cover the entire carrier flight decks. -Remotely actuated high capacity spray or water curtain systems should be installed on attack carriers to provide immediate fire protection in those specific areas on the hangar deck and flight deck where exposed ordnance stores may be concentrated preparatory to being loaded on aircraft. -Consideration should be given to employing an armored fire fighting vehicle on the flight deck of attack carriers engaged in combat operations.\n\n-A special purpose omni-directional nozzle similar to a Butterworthing nozzle be developed to spray all areas within a compartment through a small hole. -That tape recorders capable of simultaneously recording all communications with Central Control/Damage Control Central be installed on carriers, as a training aid and to assist in investigating casualties. -That specific standardized procedures be established for recording data on important events in Damage Control Central/Central Control during a casualty. -That Carrier Air Wing personnel receive more formal training in fire fighting and damage control with specific emphasis on: Fundamentals of ship's damage control organization and operations, principles inclyd in controlling damage aboard ship, basic knowledge of ship's goography, including flow patterns and escapc rutes, fundamentals and use of basic damage control and fire fighting equipment, and minimum qualifications in damage control and fire fighting. -That flight deck fire fighting exercises be developed to train personnel in fighting fires of the type experienced by FORRESTAL, taking into consideration the fire's magnitude, the live ordnance and early casualties to key personnel and equipment. -That techniques be developed for abandoning aircraft which are engulfed in flames, to provide aircrewmen with the most effective method of escape.\n\nA board of investigation was convened to look into the circumstances surrounding a fire on the USS Forrestal on July 29, 1967. The board found that no disciplinary or administrative action was warranted against any personnel attached to the Forrestal or Carrier Air Wing 17 as a result of the fire.\n\nThe Board met with and assisted the preliminary investigation that had been ordered by COMCARDIV 2 immediately after the fire. That investigative body gathered evidence invaluable to this Board. CDR BE', CD - continued to ably assist the Board throughout the investigation. The decision to order an independent preliminary inquiry was prudent as it not only produced important information which was immediately available to the Board upon their arrival at Cubi Point, but also uncovered and committed certain key witnesses in writing while events were still fresh 3-6 DR that proved d ENS B-6 B-6 and LT 13.6 in their minds and before they had discussed the matters with others.\n\nThe Board took testimony from witnesses and determined who should be designated parties on 6 August.

LT represented them from 10 August throughout the investigation. All rights were fully accorded all the parties. The Board in determining those who were to be designated as parties looked at the duties and responsibilities that were inherent in certain billets. If the duties and responsibilities appeared to have a direct relationship to matters bearing on either the initiation of the fire or the fighting of the fire they were designated as parties.\n\nAn investigation board was set up to look into a fire on the USS Forrestal. The board interviewed many witnesses and conducted experiments in order to determine the cause of the fire.\n\nThe board requested two experts to investigate the F-4B aircraft accident of July 29, 1967, which resulted in conflicts in testimonies. The board resolved these conflicts and found that no disciplinary action is necessary for those who testified falsely.\n\nThe board investigating the fire on the USS Forrestal utilized the Flat tape, which captured the events on the morning of 29 July 1967, as one of its most important pieces of evidence.\n\nThe statement reveals the difficulties encountered in the investigation of a fire on the flight deck which resulted in explosions.

Harness assemblies which pass through the adapter to connect with terminals in the LAU-17/A pylon supply power to homing and stepping circuits of the -527 TER whenever aircraft power is available.\n\nThere are nine conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the electrical circuit to fire a Zuni rocket from an F-4B aircraft on deck, most of which are switch positions. They are: aircraft power available, weapons switch in correct position, selector switch in correct position, rocket harness connected, safety pin removed, shorting device in armed position, armament safety override switch depressed, and bomb release switch depressed.\n\nThis panel provides control for firing, release, sequencing, and arming of the various external stores carried on stations 1, 2, 5, 8 and 9. The panel contains a Weapons Selector Switch, Station Selector Switch, Weapons Switch, Step Reset Switch, Bomb Arming Switch, and Interval Selector Switch. Only the Weapons Selector Switch, Station Selector Switch and Weapons Switch affect the ability to fire a rocket.\n\nThe armament system on the aircraft includes a number of safety features, including a switch that interrupts power to the armament bus when the landing gear control handle is in the down position.\n\nThe left main gear scissor switch on the USS Forrestal controls the capability to jettison all fuselage missiles and all external stores. The emergency stores switch directs power from the essential bus to energize the EXT STORES EMER REL switch when the landing gear control handle is raised.\n\nCTG 77.5 was enroute to Yankee Station with USS BAUSELL (DD-845) and USS PORTERFIELD (DD-682) in company. CTF 77 was moored at Subic Bay. Commanding Officer, USS FORRESTAL (CVA-59), was OTC of TU 77.6.1 and the ship was engaged in high tempo combat operations against North Vietnam. CVW-17 was embarked in FORRESTAL. Detachments embarked or attached were HCS-2 DET 59, HS-2 DET 59, VAW-13 DET 59, and VQ-1 DET 59. The aircraft assigned and on board at 1051H on 29 July 1967 were: 12 F-4Bs, 10 A-4Es, 8 A-6As, 5 VAW-123s, 2 KA-3Bs, 1 EA-3B, 1 EA-1F, 1 RA-5C, 1 E-2A, and 3 C-1As.\n\nOn 29 July 1967, the fifth day of combat operations on Yankee Station, the aircraft carrier Forrestal was scheduled to launch strikes as shown in the Air Plan. Conditions were good, with 10 miles visibility, 87 degrees Fahrenheit temperature, 74% humidity, and a calm sea state. The ordnance loaded on the aircraft (8 A-4s, 3 F-4s, 2 A-6s) was as follows: 2 AN-M65A1 1000 lb. bombs, 2 MK82 500 lb. bombs, 4 M17 750 lb. bombs, 2 AIM-9B (Sidewinder) missiles, 2 AIM-7E (Sparrow III) missiles, 6 LAU-10/A launchers with 4 ZUNI rockets each, 1 AIM-9D missile, 6 IAU-10/A launchers with 4 ZUNI rockets each, 2 AIM-9B missiles, 1 AIM-9D missile, 2 AIM-7E missiles, 2 AIM-9D missiles, 2 AIM-7E missiles, 1 AIM-9B missile, 1 AIM-7E missile, 18 MK82.500 lb. bombs, 2 LAU-10/A launchers with 4 ZUNI rockets each. Flight quarters were sounded at 0400H and at 1025H pilots were directed to man aircraft.\n\nAt 1051H, A-4E #405, pilot LCDR Fred D. WHITE, USN, 627870/1310, was in the third aircraft forward of the stern on the port side of the flight deck, with engine running.\n\nLCDR USN, pilot of F-4 #110, was preparing to start his port engine when the starboard engine exploded. He was killed in the explosion.\n\n-On 29 July 1967, voltage checks were conducted on the starboard side in preparation for the scheduled 1100H launch. -Loaded F-4's with ordnance were prepared on the morning of the 29th. -After the F-4's were loaded, checks were conducted on the port side of F-4 #110. -The task was completed at 1051H, and at that time the plane captain was in the vicinity of F4 #110, but his exact position is not known.\n\nA ZUNI missile fired from F-4 #110 accidentally struck and ruptured the fuel tank of A-4 #405, igniting a fire that spread to A-4 #416.\n\nA rocket exploded on the deck of the USS Forrestal, causing a fire that spread to other jets and bombs. This caused more explosions and a large fire that killed 134 people.\n\nThe fire on the flight deck was extinguished with a hand-held PKP extinguisher.\n\n40,000 gallons of fuel on board the aircraft caused the flames on the flight deck. The force of the bombs penetrated to hangar bay 3, starting fires on decks 03, 02, and 01 aft, killing 91 people. The sprinkler system in hangar bay 3 prevented the spread of fire. Personnel began jettisoning exposed explosives overboard. The fire boundary was established on the flight deck at frame 165. 3 RA-50's and 1 A-4E were jettisoned because they were on fire or leaking fuel. 134 people are dead or missing and 161 people were injured as a result of the fire and explosions.\n\nLCDR was scheduled for a flak suppression/target CAP mission with VF-11 on 29 July 1967 flying F-4B BUNO 153061, modex #110. That F-4 #110 was flown previously on the morning of 29 July, landing at 0902H. One MK82 500# bomb loaded on TER station 3 on external stores station 8 (starboard wing) did not release and was returned to the ship. As a result of this discrepancy, an armament release and control system check of station 3 of the TER-7 on external stores station 8 was conducted. The discrepancy was believed to be due to a faulty cartridge in TER station 3. LCDR was told some 5 minutes before manning his aircraft for the scheduled 1100H launch that he would be carrying ZUNIS rather than 2.75-inch rockets. CDR , CO VF-11, who was Flight Leader of the VF-11 scheduled 1100H flight, briefed LCDR B as to the changes in flight procedures which would be required because of the loading change to ZUNIS. He emphasized particularly sight settings and whether or not to bring the empty launchers back to the ship. That no mention was made during the above briefing as to checking shorting devices on the LAU-10/A launchers during the pre-flight inspection of the aircraft. That F-4 #110 was spotted on the extreme starboard quarter of the flight deck, headed inboard, at approximately a 45 degree angle to the ship's head. LCDR in his pre-flight inspection of F-4 # 110, noted particularly the following: a. LAU-10/A launchers Frangible firings (forward) - Selector switches a. b. b. TER-7 Electrical and mechanical safety pins in; ordnance secure; rocket harnesses unplugged. C. Sidewinder Safety pins in; no cover on port Sidewinder. -15 Neither LCDR nor LTJG I his RIO, checked the shorting devices on the LAU-10/A launchers loaded on F-4 #110.\n\nLCDR started his starboard engine on F-4 #110, deselected air at 45% RPM, and, as the engine stabilized at 65%, selected both generators. As he did so, a mild explosion shook the aircraft and he saw an object hit A-4 #405 parked on the port side of the ship. LCDR's immediate impression was that one of the ZUNI rockets had fired from his aircraft.\n\nA voltmeter is used to check for stray voltage in the circuit of a rocket harness as a safety measure before the harness is connected. This is done on attack carriers operating on Yankee Station before combat strikes. The practice, though not documented, was well known and approved. On the morning of 29 July 1967, while preparing to conduct a stray voltage check on the port side of F-4 #110, B noticed that the check had already been done on the starboard side. The check on the port side was conducted while the aircraft engines were being started and while the aircraft was still on external electrical power, which is before the aircraft's electrical system had stabilized. There was no official documentation at the time specifying when, how, or why this stray voltage check should be conducted or that it must be conducted after an aircraft is started and has switched to internal electrical power.\n\nMeasurable transient voltages occur in F-4B aircraft when switching from external to internal electrical power. VF-11 had two conventional weapons loading teams; one under AOL LIGHTSEY and the other under AOL ROGERS. The VF-11 ordnance CPO, B, and the two VF-11 conventional weapons loading team leaders, 36 and B considered it safe to conduct stray voltage checks and to plug in rockets while the aircraft was still on external electrical power. Commander CO of VF-11, considered it safe to plug in rockets while the F-4 was still on external electrical power but stated that it was squadron policy not to do so. VF-11 squadron policy and procedures with regard to conducting stray voltage checks and plugging in rockets were not documented.\n\nThe ZUNI can fire from an F-4B configured as was F-4 #110 preparatory to the scheduled 1100H launch on 29 July, even though all cockpit armament switches are in the prescribed (safe) positions, if the following conditions exist simultaneously: a. If current is present at the TER-7 in the stepping and firing circuit. b. If the select rockets solenoid switch in the TER-7 is closed (in the firing position). C. If the TER-7 electrical safety switch is in the armed position. If the TER-7 rocket harness is connected to the LAU-10/A. e. If the LAU-10/A shorting device is not grounding the launcher circuitry.\n\nModel -527 TER-7 racks on FORRESTAL were incorrectly wired, causing a malfunction that led to the fire on 29 July 1967.\n\nThe officers responsible for the safety of the USS Forrestal were charged with absolute responsibility for the safety of the ship and its crew. The Engineering Officer was responsible for supervising and directing the control of damage in the ship caused by casualty, flooding, or fire, and the Fire Marshall was responsible for supervising and directing the fighting of fires in the ship.\n\nThe officers mentioned were assigned various duties related to fire fighting, crash removal, and ordnance handling, among other things.\n\nThe FORRESTAL underwent an extensive overhaul at the NNSY from April 15, 1966 to January 23, 1967. After completing the overhaul, the FORRESTAL participated in various exercises and training sessions, including INSURV Trials and Refresher Training, before departing for the WESTPAC on July 6, 1967.\n\nThe USS Forrestal had an average on-board count of 140 officers and 2775 men belonging to ship's company upon completion of overhaul on 23 January 1967. An operational readiness inspection was conducted during the period 30 January to 3 February 1967 to identify material discrepancies. The overall condition of damage control within the ship was barely satisfactory. Upon completion of post repair trials and refresher training, the USS Forrestal departed Norfolk, Virginia, for deployment to WESTPAC on 6 June 1967.\n\n-During transit to Cubi Point, FORRESTAL conducted extensive training in damage control and fire fighting, which is detailed in enclosure (89). -FORRESTAL's average on board count during overhaul was 2,796 men, 54% of which were transferred after the overhaul. -Since the overhaul, FORRESTAL has had a net gain of 51 enlisted men and 34 supervisory personnel.\n\nThe FORRESTAL conducted general quarters training periods and training in fire fighting evolutions from January to July 1967. 1,332 officers and men graduated from fire fighting schools during this time period. The ship's weapons were documented in the USS FORRESTAL Instruction 03510.2E of 2 May 1967.\n\nThe meeting on 29 June 1967 established ordnance handling procedures to be used in WESTPAC deployment, which were validated by inspectors during the Operational Readiness Inspection.\n\n-The minutes of the 29 June meeting were taken and read by all attendees. -A double spaced copy of the agreements reached was distributed to squadrons and divisions for their correction of any ambiguous statement. -On 8 July another draft of the agreements of the 29 June meeting was written, incorporating corrections which had been recommended. This draft was not distributed to either squadrons or divisions. -In so far as CO, FORRESTAL, ship's Operations Officer, and COMCVW-17 were concerned, the procedures as used in the ORI relating to the ZUNI, remained in effect.\n\nC. LT 36 USN was the ordnance officer responsible for advising COMCVW-17 in ordnance matters, acting as a liaison between ship/squadrons/COMCVW-17 on ordnance matters, performing quality control checks of ordnance loading, and making spot checks of general flight deck ordnance evolutions. D. CDR USN was the commanding officer of VF-11 responsible for the overall operational readiness of his squadron, the effective preparation of his squadron for all missions, and the actual loading of conventional munitions on VF-11 aircraft, including the responsibility for the observance of ordnance safety precautions by VF-11 personnel. B-t B-6 e. LCDR Jr., USN was the aircraft maintenance officer responsible for the accomplishment of the mission of his department, which included the avionics/weapons division and the weapons branch. f. LT 36 7, USN was the avionics/weapons division officer responsible for ensuring compliance with all safety precautions by personnel of his division and preparing and submitting divisional reports.\n\nWOL 3-1 was the assistant avionics/weapons division officer for VF-11, responsible for assisting the avionics/weapons division officer and training ordnancemen. 60 USNR, B-E was the weapons branch officer for VF-11, responsible for the proper performance of duties assigned to the weapons branch. 5-6 was the chief aviation ordnanceman and aviation ordnance supervisor for VF-11, responsible for assisting LTJG ROWAN and supervising all duties assigned to the weapons branch.\n\nCVW-17 was commissioned in 1966 and assigned to the USS FORRESTAL for the 1967 Southeast Asia Deployment. The squadrons and detachment were never joined together for operations as a Carrier Air Wing until the departure of FORRESTAL from Norfolk, Virginia on 6 June 1967.\n\nCDR B-6 went on an advance liaison trip to the Far East to the carriers on Yankee Station and returned to the FORRESTAL on 15 July 1967. That before departure, CDR B-L discussed with Captain BELING the desirability of having a Weapons Coordination Board meeting during the ship's transit to WESTPAC, in order to conduct a detailed study and documentation of CVA-59/CVW-17 weapons handling procedures, as developed before and as used during the ORI. The Weapons Coordination Board, augment by key members of the Weapons Planning Board, met to document those ordnance handling procedures which had been validated during the ORI.\n\nThe minutes of the meeting were given to all squadrons divisions in a double-spaced rough draft for their correction of ambiguous statements. Any changes of substance would have to be at a subsequent meeting.\n\nThe minutes from a meeting on June 29th regarding the connection of a rocket pack pigtail were revised and sent back for further transmittal. The CO of VF-11 did not see the changes made to the minutes. The recommendation from the meeting was that non-propulsive units be installed on AIM-9 missiles loaded on aircraft on the hangar deck.\n\n1. A copy of the approved procedures from the 29 June meeting was necessary to formalize the decisions. 2. AOC nquired of LTJG Air Wing Ordnance CPO) several times before 29 July 1967 whether a finalized approved version of the decisions had been received. 3. LTJC briefed the officers of VF-11, including CDR as to the results of the 29 June meeting during a squadron conference, held for other reasons, just after the completion of the 29 June Weapons Coordination Board meeting. 4. During July 1967 a number of pilots of VF-11 complained to A01 VF-11 safety ordnance petty officer, that there were too many personnel around their aircraft during turn-up, and questioned the necessity for a safety ordnance petty officer when ordnance was being connected in the pack. 5. LTJC agreed that the safety petty officer was not necessary in the pack as long as the plane captains were instructed not to give the pilots any signals to move any switches actuating flaps, hook, etc., actuation of which could possibly cause injuries to the ordnancemen under the aircraft. 6. CDR considered that the purpose of the \"hands-off\" signal to the pilot, while ordnancemen were working under the aircraft, was (a) to prevent injury to the ordnancemen and (b) to prevent blame of the pilot if any ordnance was accidently fired or dropped. 7. CDR verbally approved the policy of eliminating the use of the \"hands-off\" signal and the ordnance safety petty officer in the pack. 8. The elimination of the hands-off\" signal in the pack was in contradiction to paragraph 1d (4) of the draft memorandum dated 8 July 1967. 9. CDR and LT were not informed of the change in procedure by VF-11 with regard to elimination of the use of the ordnance safety petty officer in the pack. 10. LTB-E did not detect the fact that VF-11 was no longer using the \"hands-off\" signal in the pack.\n\nCDR 3 considered it policy in VF-11 to conduct stray voltage checks after both engines had been started, but several VF-11 ordnancemen believed that the stray voltage test could be made anytime after power was applied to the aircraft.\n\nElectrical safety pins occasionally failed mechanically and were pulled from the racks by the wind, leading to a policy change of leaving the pins in until the aircraft arrived at the catapult.\n\nThis document contains findings of fact regarding a triple ejector rack (P/N 5821520-527) with 3 LAU-10/A launchers. The section provides detailed procedures for loading and arming rockets on an F-4B aircraft, including checks for stray voltage.\n\nNAVWEFS OP 2210 requires a stray voltage test be performed prior to connecting the rocket harness to the launcher, as a general precaution for aircraft rocket launcher packages. VF-11 had devised a procedure and fabricated a test, harness, prior to 29 July, for the purpose of conducting a stray voltage check of the rocket firing circuits of the F-4B/TER combination. The procedure actually followed by VF-11 ordnance personnel consisted of connecting a Missile Launcher Stray Voltage Test Set to each of the rocket harnesses of the TER, at any time when electrical power was available to the TER, as indicated by illumination of HOMING INDICATOR LIGHT, and testing each station in turn for the presence of stray voltage prior to connecting the rocket harness into the LAU-10/A receptacle. However, NAVAIRSYSCOMHQ messages 052222Z AUG 67 and 091903Z AUG 67 (enclosure (367), received after the 29 July accident) recommend that stray voltage checks be conducted after engines were started, when aircraft was operating on internal power, rather than at any time that electrical power was available to the TER.\n\nThe wiring of the safety switch in the -527 TERs in use aboard FORRESTAL was incorrect, which made it possible for a high magnitude current to damage or burn out the safety switch. Additionally, the direction of throw of the HOME-STEP switch on the -527 TER is reversed from the direction of actuation on the -505 and -521 TERS, and tests of the LAU-10/A shorting device demonstrated that the shorting device is not reliable.\n\nThe kinescope of the PLAT recording of the sequence of events on 29 July demonstrated that the white puff or flash which seemed to be off the port bow at 10-51-21H was caused by an image which appeared to be between the camera lens and the forward flight deck.\n\nNAVAIRSYSCOMHQ 2514362 AUG 67. 75 294* That enclosure (381), page 12 of NAVWEPS OP3347, USN Ordnance Safety Precautions, contains statements or requirements which are vague, incomplete, or inapplicable to modern attack carrier aircraft.\n\nCondition Zebra was Satisfactory, but there were some minor damage control deficiencies.\n\nHoses on the flight deck were faked and uncharged at the time of the first major explosion.\n\nFour of sixteen HCFF stations were manned at the start of the fire on the second deck. Word was immediately passed over the 1MC to \"man all fog foam stations.\" Many personnel did not reach their general quarters stations. Difficulty was experienced in promptly leading out and charging HCFF stations 11, 12 and 13 in the early stages of the fire. One or more fog foam stations were not initially charged because personnel manning the hose either did not know it was necessary to perform certain manual functions on the flight deck to actuate the system, or, did not know how to do so.\n\nThere is no pattern to the physical relationship of the valve, actuating button, phone, and call button.", "context_total_tokens": 12743, "context_total_mb": 0.012743, "system_instructions": ["emojis"], "user_prompts": ["ADEPT2-publishing-information", "Create list of abbreviations", "Recommend parts of the book"], "custom_user_prompt": "", "mode": "part", "thisdoc_dir": "/Users/fred/bin/Codexes2Gemini/Codexes2Gemini/output/c2g", "output_file": "output", "limit": 8000, "ensure_output_limit": false, "minimum_required_output_tokens": 500, "log_level": "DEBUG"}]}
