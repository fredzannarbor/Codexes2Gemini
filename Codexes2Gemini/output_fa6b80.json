At their heart they need\npropulsion. Massive diesel engines and their associated machinery are crammed\ninto small steel hulls. This takes up around half of the space inside. Batteries, required for underwater propulsion, take up another chunk. And the fuel tanks yet\nmore. All this valuable space given over just to propelling the submarine along.\nBut what if it fails?\nThe unusual tale of R-14 verges on myth and legend. Yet it is real, as told here\nby David L. Johnston and Ric Hedman. It is a unique story, and one which is entertaining, inspirational and educational.\nToday submarine crews are drilled in safety. What to do in the event of fire,\nflooding, medical emergencies, gas and so much more is committed to memory.\nWhat to do if you run out of power in the middle of the ocean, with no communications, and only a few days of provisions, is not something you think of.\nIn 1921, the submarine was called upon to render assistance to a ship in distress. A tug boat had gone missing. Yet R-14 would herself soon become the one\nwhich needed rescuing. Finding herself without power, she drifted, dangerously\nlow on food and and hope. The ingenuity of the crew saved her, and their lives.\nThe brave tale of how they improvised to overcome a seemingly impossible situation is valuable for leaders in any domain. How a seemingly mundane task\nquickly turned deadly. And how a strong understanding of the basics allowed the\ncrew to be saved.\nThe tug boat was not so lucky.\nToday perhaps the scenario could not play out the same. The distances involved\nfeel short by modern standards. Especially with aircraft and faster submarines.\nBut the ocean is vast, and the same human qualities of resourcefulness, resolve\nand teamwork remain every bit as important. The story of R-14 is as much a human tale as a submarine fact check. It is something which everyone can relate to.\nH. I. Sutton\nNaval analyst, \u201cCovert Shores\"\nix\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nx\n\nx\n\n\fPREFACE\nThere are stories of the sea that involve bravery, perseverance, innovation, adaptation, and strength of character. Some stories highlight the foibles and fallibility of humanity, and many contain lessons for the mariner that still resonate today.\nThe saga of the submarine USS R-14 (SS-91) during a search and rescue operation off the coast of Hawaii in 1921 certainly contains all of those elements. It is a\nstory unique in the annals of the United States Navy\u2019s Submarine Service and runs\nthe gamut from simple human error to inspiring, out-of-the-box problem solving.\nPigBoats.COM webmaster and author Ric Hedman first began this story over\n10 years ago but never completed it. I have been a close friend and associate of\nRic\u2019s since 2001, assisting him with historical research and photographic analysis.\nRic asked me if I would like to take a crack at it, and after debating for quite some\ntime, I decided, with Ric\u2019s enthusiastic permission, to finish it. Much of what you\nsee in the narrative below came directly from Ric\u2019s efforts, I simply refined and\nexpanded on his earlier work.\nThe overwhelming majority of the story was lifted directly from the official Log\nBook, USS R-14, Jan. 1, 1921 to Dec. 31, 1921. We also used contemporary newspaper\narticles, navigational charts, atlases, personal accounts from the crewmembers\nand their families, and other printed material as sources. Ric and I have always\nemphasized accuracy in our work as historians, and everything that you will read\nbelow is as true to facts as we can possibly make it.\nHowever, we must insert one very large caveat: the spoken dialogue between\nthe crew was never recorded anywhere and is entirely of our own creation. All of\nthe principals in this story have long since passed so it can\u2019t be known for sure\nwhat conversations passed between these men. In order to provide the reader\nwith a personal connection to the story, we wanted to humanize it a bit and thus\nthe back-and-forth dialogue. Ric and I are both Navy veterans and qualified in\nsubmarines. Ric served on both nuclear and diesel submarines in the 1960s, and I\nserved on a diesel boat in the 1980s as part of a 21-year career that also included\ntours of duty on minesweepers and destroyers. We relied on the experience of\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nthese combined twenty-seven years of naval service to faithfully as possible recreate some of the conversations and scenes contained herein.\nA small amount of speculation occurs in other parts of the narrative. For instance, there is a passage where a sailor is discharged from the service, and a short\ntime later he re-enlisted. That event actually happened because it is documented\nin the deck log. However, the actions of the sailor and his shipmates during and\nbetween the two ceremonies is largely our informed speculation.\nThere are three main purposes to this work: 1) to tell a great and entertaining\nsea story; 2) to provide an analysis of the events to the reader so that they may\nunderstand what happened and why; and 3) to provide lessons learned to the present-day Navy in leadership, perseverance, and innovative thinking. There will\nbe points in this story in which we must adopt a tone critical to the crew, and this\nis done in order to discuss the truth of the events. Ric and I have the greatest respect and admiration for Alexander D. Douglas and the crew of the R-14, the bond\nof brotherhood to our fellow submariners being quite strong. In no way is it our\ndesire to sully the memory of anyone\u2019s family member, but in order to learn the\nlessons from this incident, it will be necessary to discuss the human mistakes that\nwere made. We treat all sailors mentioned herein with the greatest respect possible, and we would like to apologize in advance to anyone who might look askance\nat our efforts.\nThank you for reading.\nDCC(SS/SW) David L.

Johnston, USN (Ret.)\n\nA native of Dexter, MI., Chief Johnston enlisted in the Navy in September 1983.\nOver the course of a 21-year career Chief Johnston served on the USS Darter (SS576), four Mine Countermeasures ships, and the USS Forrest Sherman (DDG-98).\nHe has been on the staffs of Navy Operational Support Centers in Des Moines IA,\nBrunswick ME, Rochester NY, Battle Creek MI, and on the staff of the Supervisor\nof Shipbuilding, Bath ME. He has made four overseas deployments to Japan and\nthe western Pacific, the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and the Gulf of Aden. He retired\nfrom active duty in August, 2019.\nHis awards include the Navy Commendation Medal, Navy Achievement Medal,\nNavy Good Conduct Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary and Service\nMedals, Armed Forces Reserve Medal w/ \u201cM\u201d device, and a COMSUBGRU 7 Letter\nof Commendation. Chief Johnston is qualified in submarines and surface warfare.\nDuring a break in service in the 1990s, he worked in the travel, security, and\nretail industries.\nxiii\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nChief Johnston is the author of the Visual Guide series of articles concerning\nUS submarine identification and two of his articles on submarine history have\nbeen published by the Naval Submarine League in The Submarine Review. He is\na team member with the Lost 52 Project as a research historian, and is an editor of\nthe project\u2019s quarterly newsletter. Chief Johnston is the co-founder of the website\nPigBoats.COM and has been a contributor to the US Naval Institute\u2019s Proceedings\nmagazine. He is a volunteer photo analyst and researcher for Navsource.org. He\nresides in Norfolk, Virginia with his wife Theresa.\n\nRIC HEDMAN\n\nFigure 2. TN(SS) Richard C. Hedman, USN\n\nBorn and raised in the state of Washington, Ric was primarily brought up in\nthe Seattle area. After high school graduation in 1964 he enlisted in the Navy and\nattended boot camp and \u201cA\u201d school in San Diego, CA where he volunteered for\nduty in submarines. After attending Submarine School at Submarine Base New\nLondon in Groton CT in 1965, he was assigned to the pre-commissioning crew of\nthe Thresher class submarine USS Flasher (SSN-613), under construction at General Dynamics/Electric Boat in Groton, CT. After commissioning Flasher changed\nhomeports to Hawaii, and from there Ric deployed on numerous patrols to the\nnorthern, western and central Pacific. After slightly over four years on active\nduty, he transitioned to the Navy Reserve and was assigned to the Submarine Reserve Unit in Seattle, where he completed his six-year military obligation. During\nthis period, he performed temporary duty on the diesel submarine USS Cusk (SS348), shortly before her decommissioning.\nHis service awards include the Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation Ribbon,\nNavy Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, and the Korean Defense Service Medal. He is qualified in submarines.\nWhile in civilian life he worked in various professions, learning skills that later\nserved him well. An avid sailor, he operated his own business performing yacht\nand small boat repair, and lived on and operated his own sailboat for ten years.\nTransitioning jobs once again, he spent 14 years in the Bio-Tech industry in the\nMaterials Management role, taking several companies from their startup phases\ninto Food & Drug Administration-approved production of their products.\nDuring this time Ric developed a passion for the early history of the submarine\nservice and began producing a small web page about that era, learning as he went\nalong. This culminated in the creation of PigBoats.COM with author and historian\nDavid Johnston. Along the way he has collaborated with numerous authors on\nsubmarine history matters, serving as a technical advisor on approximately a\ndozen books and manuscripts. He is a member of the local Seattle base of the\nUnited States Submarine Veterans, Inc. and has been its Base Commander on\nthree different occasions. He resides in Mountlake Terrace, WA.\n\nxv\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nAUTHORS\u2019 NOTES & ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nDAVE\nOne lazy summer afternoon when I was eight years old, I found myself bored,\nso I starting perusing my father\u2019s book collection looking for something to pass\nthe time. There I found a first edition copy of On The Bottom, written in 1929 by\nEdward Ellsberg. It was the story of the sinking and salvage of the submarine USS\nS-51 (SS-162) in 1925 and 1926. I found it utterly fascinating and I quickly read it\nfrom cover to cover. I didn\u2019t fully understand it at first, as there were some advanced technical stuff in it, but it proved to be the genesis of a life-long fascination\nwith the sea and submarines. It lead me to join the Navy in 1983 and volunteer for\nsubmarine service. That early fascination stayed with me throughout my service\nand in later years. I became a devoted historian, with On The Bottom becoming a\nvalued member of my library.\nRic Hedman was the original author of this work. He completed the majority of\nthe research and wrote about thirty-two pages of narrative before experiencing a\nsevere case of writer\u2019s block. I have been working with Ric as a partner on the web\npage PigBoats.COM for twenty years, and one day a few years back Ric approached\nme about finishing the story, which I found fascinating. Still on active duty with\nthe Navy at the time, the project had to wait for my retirement and the completion\nof two other projects before I was able to give it the attention that it deserved. I\ntook Ric\u2019s initial narrative and greatly expanded on it. Ric and I shared hundreds\nof phone calls and emails by the time of publication as we worked on the project,\nand we equally share in the content of this work, of which we are very proud.\nRoy Trent Gallemore\u2019s family have been key contributors of information. The\nwillingness of Roy\u2019s grandchildren and great grandchildren Bruce Gallemore, Roy\nA. Smith, and Katie Eliot to help us and provide insights into their grandfather\u2019s\nhistory and character were a key to success. We would like to pass on to them our\nsincere thanks and appreciation.\n\nxvi\n\nxvi\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nNoted historian Jim Christley provided background information on the technical aspects of the R-class submarines and his willing assistance is greatly appreciated. His illustrations greatly enhance our work, and for that we are very grateful. Michael Mohl, the webmaster of the submarine pages at Navsource.org, contributed photos and his pages provided very useful research. Author William Tidd\ntook information from the logs and meticulously created the graphic in Part One\nthat shows the R-14\u2019s track. My wife Theresa Street was my editor and coach. Her\nhelp, encouragement, and guidance were of inestimable value.\nLastly, to Alexander Dean Douglas, Roy Trent Gallemore, Harry Woodworth,\nand the entire 1921 crew of the R-14, Ric and I would like to express our admiration\nand gratitude for the lessons in perseverance, innovative thinking, and seamanship. We hope that through this narrative you will not be forgotten.\nDCC(SS/SW) David L. Johnston, USN (Ret.)\u2014August 2021\n\nRIC\nWithout the tremendous assistance of Dave Johnston, this work would never\nhave seen the light of day. I knew when writing it I didn\u2019t have the right line of\nattack on the story and I had wanted it to be more than I had been able to come up\nwith.\nThe story began years prior when I was just starting the web page \u201cThrough\nthe Looking Glass\u201d, which later morphed into PigBoats.COM. In about 2000, along\nwith my local submarine veterans\u2019 group, we made a visit to the USS Alabama\n(SSBN-731) when she visited Seattle. In the Chief\u2019s Mess, I saw a framed copy of\nthe famous photo of the R-14 under sail. I was fascinated with it and it proved to\nbe an inspiration. A few years later I was contacted by Robert Suess, son of Raymond Suess, who had been aboard the R-14 during the incident and had gotten\nhimself immortalized as the man standing in the foreground of the sailing photo.\nRobert Suess had no one in his family who wanted his dad\u2019s submarine photo collection (many crew and interior images) and wanted to know if I was interested\nin having them. I quickly agreed. This collection included an original print of a\npublic domain photo that resides in the National Archives. I estimated that there\nwere approximately twenty prints of this photo made after they returned to port,\nwith the intention of giving one to any crewmember that wanted one. One copy\neventually made it to the National Archives. Suess kept his print for many years\nxvii\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nand even took steps to preserve it by encasing it in an early form of lamination.\nThere was no doubt this was a prized family possession. It is now framed and\nhangs on my wall. Thus began my quest for the full story.\nI worked as much of it as I could for a number of years, getting all the research\nthat could be found from various sources. I soon reached a wall knowing there was\nmore, but I was at a loss as to the direction that needed to be taken. I tucked it away\nonly to repeatedly take it out and toy with it. Dave and I had talked about it over\nthe years. Finally, a decision was reached and the research materials and notebooks were packed and the whole works shipped to Dave. He has taken the story\ninto the direction where it needed to go, and I\u2019m pleased to no end with the results.\nThere is undoubtedly more to the story but after a century has passed, people and\nresources have about come to their end. The COVID pandemic also made further\ninformation-gathering problematic. I\u2019m hoping that another historian will eventually come up with something we missed and shine the light on a new angle. This,\nfor now, is about as far as we can take it.\nIt was tough and Dave was a steadying force. With both of us being Qualified\nSubmariners we are trained to know and understand the boat\u2019s operations to the\nextent that we can operate them in total darkness. We wanted to know the \u201cwhy\u201d\nand found that keeping on track proved difficult at times. We hope you like the\nresult.\nAlong with the acknowledgments given by Dave, I\u2019d like to include Raymond\nSuess and his family, especially his son Robert, for gifting the whole set of photos\nto a complete stranger and making this wonderful story possible.\nTN(SS) Ric Hedman, USN\u2014August 2021\n\nxviii\n\nxviii\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nABBREVIATIONS\nBQ\n\nBethlehem Quincy\n\nCO\n\nCommanding Officer\n\nCOB\n\nChief of the Boat\n\nCPO\n\nChief Petty Officer\n\nEB\n\nElectric Boat\n\nNOAA\n\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n\nOOD\n\nOfficer-of the Deck\n\nNELSECO\n\nNew London Ship and Engine Company\n\nNHHC\n\nNaval History and Heritage Command\n\nSUBDIV\n\nSubmarine Division\n\nxix\n\n\f\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nPUBLISHER\u2019S NOTE\nThe port city of Hilo on the Big Island of Hawaii plays an important role in this\nstory as R-14\u2019s emergency destination.

Gann\n\n\f\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nMONDAY, 02 MAY 1921, 8:00 A.M.\n\n1\n\nIt is a beautiful day in the United States Territory of Hawaii. It is a still relatively cool 76\u00ba F, with a casual southeast breeze of five miles per hour keeping the\noppressive humidity manageable at this early point in the day. Along the south\nshore of the isle of Oahu the breeze is creating small wavelets with glassy crests\nnot yet breaking. The wind is slowly pushing some tenuous cotton puff altocumulus clouds off into the northern Pacific. With the barometer holding steady at\n29.90, there are the makings of a fine day here in this Polynesian/American tropical paradise.2\nThe mouth of Pearl Harbor cuts north from the south shore, with the channel\nforming the trunk of an odd-shaped tree as it moves up and spreads out into seven\nsmaller bays, known to the Navy as lochs. The large central East Loch is broken\ninto north and south channels by the oblong-shaped Ford Island. Once the site of\na sugar cane plantation, it is now the home of the Army Air Corps Luke Field and\nthe brand-new Naval Air Station Pearl Harbor, its seaplane ramps and hangars\nlocated at the island\u2019s southeast corner. On the shallow and muddy water within\nthe harbor, a place revered by the native Hawaiian people and known to be a\nbirthplace for hammerhead sharks, barely a ripple disturbs the surface, A portion\nof the United States Navy\u2019s Pacific Fleet is present on this day.\nA small but growing base was established here in 1905 as a coaling station for\nthe Pacific Fleet ships, and steady work since then expanded the base considerably, supplanting the facilities in nearby Honolulu. The Navy Yard was established\nalong the south channel adjacent to Ford Island and it contained a hospital, a large\ndrydock (with three more planned), a foundry, numerous factory-style workshops and warehouses, and several repair basins and piers. The fleet itself was not\nyet based here, but its ships made regular port calls during fleet maneuvers. Most\n\nIn May, 1921 the USN had not yet adopted the 24-hour clock. All times in the ship\u2019s log are in the\n12-hour format, so we will adhere to that standard here.\n2\nAstronomical and weather data was compiled from published information from the Astronomical\nApplications Dept., U.S. Naval Observatory, Washington, D.C., and from the R-14 log.\n1\n\n1\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nof the ships actually stationed at the base consisted of patrol craft, auxiliaries and\nyard craft, and a contingent of the Pacific Fleet\u2019s submarines.\nThe site chosen for Submarine Base Pearl Harbor is on the east side of the harbor, at the intersection of Magazine Loch and Quarry Loch. It sits on sandy land\novergrown with tropical scrub brush and prickly cactus, and is just southeast and\na stone\u2019s throw from a small marshy islet called Kuahua. Two finger piers protrude out into Southeast Loch from the triangular-shaped base, and a narrowgauge rail line connecting the small base to the larger nearby Navy Yard meanders\nsouth along the shore of Quarry Loch. The base was willed into existence through\nthe discipline and determination of its first Commanding Officer (CO), Commander Chester W. Nimitz, and through the gritty hard work of four loyal and\nearnest Chief Petty Officers (CPOs) on his staff, who at times resorted to less than\ncompletely honest methods to acquire the scarce materials and assistance needed\nto build the base in this remote paradise.3\nSubmarine Division 14, consisting of 10 R-class submarines, calls the base\nhome. The division is headquartered on the old and inoperative cruiser USS Chicago (CA-14) moored nearby at a narrow pier at the opening of Magazine Loch. The\nR-class submarines were designed and built during the First World War as coastal\npatrol boats, with a mission to range out from American bases, patrolling for any\npotential enemy that may approach the coastline. Despite their status as coastal\nboats, these submarines are among the largest and most capable in use by the USN\nin the early 1920s. They are 186 feet long and eighteen feet wide, with a displacement of 574 tons surfaced and 685 tons submerged. Twin NELSECO 6-EB-14 diesel\nengines drive them at 12.5 knots surfaced, and when submerged, large storage\nbatteries provide power to drive electric motors providing a maximum speed of\n9.3 knots. There are four 21-inch torpedo tubes forward and each boat carried\neight torpedoes. For surface action there is a 3\u201d/50 caliber Mk 6 gun mounted on\nthe forward deck. They are outfitted for three officers and twenty-seven crew and\nare rated for 30 days at sea.\nThis day is a busy one, and the finger piers are buzzing with activity. The USS\nR-14 (SS-91) is moored alongside sister boat R-11 at Pier 1. The day\u2019s Duty Officer\naboard R-14 is Lieutenant Alexander Dean Douglas, USN, a short and compact,\ndark-haired, lean-faced native of Iowa. Douglas is a competent, well-regarded,\nand affable officer who to family and friends is known simply as \u201cDean.\u201d He is\n3\n\n2\n\nNimitz, E.B. Potter, 1976, page 132-134.\n2\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nofficially the boat\u2019s Executive Officer, or second in command; however, for the last\nseveral months he has also been designated as the Acting Commanding Officer.\nDue to a shortage of qualified officers at this remote duty station, the boat\u2019s official\nCO, Lieutenant Vincent A. Clarke, Jr., has been pulled away for temporary duty as\nthe Engineering Officer for SUBDIV 14. The division\u2019s CO, Commander Nimitz,\n(with additional responsibilities as the CO of Chicago and the Sub Base) has pulled\nClarke to his staff in order to ensure that all of his division\u2019s boats are getting the\nrepairs and maintenance necessary to be fully operational. Nimitz makes the unusual choice of pulling Clarke from the R-14 without a relief in place because of the\noverriding need to fill the division\u2019s gapped Engineering Officer billet. Both Nimitz and Clarke are confident that the younger Douglas can handle the boat; indeed,\nif necessary, Clarke is readily available to look over Douglas\u2019ss shoulder, review\nhis actions, and provide advice. When more officers become available, Nimitz retains the option of officially promoting Douglas to CO and bringing in an ensign to\nround out the R-14\u2019s officer billets, or getting the boat a new CO if Douglas needs\nmore time to season. So far, Douglas has been performing brilliantly.\nThe last bugle notes of \u201cCarry On\u201d fade away after morning colors and Douglas\npresides over the crew mustered for quarters on the pier. With the men lined up\nneatly by division in front of him, he waits patiently as the muster roll call is performed. All are present and accounted for, the only exception being a sailor who\nis still in the base hospital. Orders for the day are read and work schedules and\nassignments are given out. The senior enlisted man on the boat is Chief Gunner\u2019s\nMate (Torpedo) Harry Woodworth of Omaha. In his job as Chief of the Boat, or\nCOB, Woodworth is the Captain\u2019s get-it-done man. After conferring with Douglas\nand the other Department Heads, he is put in charge of the day\u2019s work. Once the\ncrew has been dismissed, they turn-to and begin cleaning, repairing, painting,\nand taking garbage to the containers on the pier. Bedding has been brought topside and is airing over the wire lifelines.\nA small ceremony is conducted on the pier at 10:00 a.m. by Douglas, to discharge Machinist Mate 1st class Hugh McNamara from his enlistment in the Navy.\nWith most of the crew engaged in vital ship\u2019s work, the ceremony is mostly attended by his division work mates. Naval regulations require that a sailor be officially discharged at the end of his enlistment before any further career action can\nbe taken. After Douglas reads aloud the official notice of Discharge of Enlistment,\ncheerful, raucous, and joking suggestions of making a run for it before the Captain\nor the COB tries to talk him into re-enlisting fly from his shipmates. The guys slap\n3\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nhim on the back and ask him how it feels to be a civilian again. McNamara fully\nintends to re-enlist, but Navy paperwork must be filed and he takes his discharge\npapers, hurrying up the pier and over to the Chicago so that the SUBDIV 14 yeoman\ncan file them and process the re-enlistment papers. The ceremony quickly breaks\nup and ten minutes later, the Auxiliaries Department that McNamara is attached\nto gets back to work and begins an air charge using both compressors, refilling the\nboat\u2019s high-pressure air banks.\n\n4\n4\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nFigure 3.

Bridges, members\nof the R-14\u2019s crew during the sailing incident. Bridges is engaged in one of the never-ending\ntasks for a sailor of the day, washing clothes. This was done in a bucket with the uniform laid\nout on a bench erected on the pier for scrubbing. This photo is illustrative of the many different types of clothes worn by the crews of these early submarines. The environment aboard\nthese boats was very hard on uniforms, so the crews tended to wear whatever they could find\nwhile working on the boat, preserving the expensive uniforms for formal in-port functions.\nPhoto from the Suess Family Collection via PigBoats.COM.\n9\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nFigure 8.

In the upper center is Kuahua Island, whose\nnorthern end would be eventually filled in to form a peninsula. To the right of Kuahua can be\nseen the two finger piers and single building of the budding submarine base, yet to see Nimitz\u2019s full attention.

An Eagle-class patrol boat is moored at Pier #2 with the subs. Magazine Loch\nis on the left with Quarry Loch on the right. A road in the background would connect the base\nwith the towns of Aiea and Kalauao to the left, and the Navy Yard to the right. There also\nappears to be a narrow-gauge railroad between the road and buildings. In later years a large\npetroleum tank farm would be built in the background and everything on the left and right\nwould be developed into the growing base.

This photo provides a good representation of the configuration of the R-class submarines. The conning tower fairwater and\nbridge can be seen amidships. The vertical white stripes on R-20 and the white X on R-12 were\npart of a system in place, unique to the R-boats in Hawaii, that facilitated long range visual\nidentification of the boats while surfaced. Just forward of the fairwater is the flared-out deck\nfor the 3\u201d/50 caliber Mk 6 gun, which is in its stowed position pointed aft. The bow planes are\nfolded up alongside the forward superstructure, just aft of the anchor. The tube at the bow is\na towing fairlead hawsepipe. The torpedo tubes are below the waterline and not visible.
