**1. Glossary of Terms:**

Imagine there's a lawyer named Mr. Utterson who has a friend, Dr. Jekyll, who is a very kind and respected man. But Dr. Jekyll has a secret: he has a hidden, evil side named Mr. Hyde.

Mr. Hyde is small, ugly, and mean. He's like a scary monster who does bad things. Mr. Utterson learns about Mr. Hyde and gets worried about Dr. Jekyll. 

Mr. Utterson and Mr. Enfield, another friend, see Mr. Hyde do something horrible: he steps on a little girl and doesn't care. Later, Mr. Hyde commits a terrible crime: he kills an old man with a stick. 

Mr. Utterson and the police go looking for Mr. Hyde but can't find him. Dr. Jekyll acts like nothing's wrong, but Mr. Utterson knows something is terribly wrong. 

Dr. Jekyll's friend, Dr. Lanyon, also gets scared because he sees Mr. Hyde do something scary. 

Dr. Jekyll writes a letter to Mr. Utterson explaining that he has a secret potion. When he drinks it, he turns into Mr. Hyde. He tells Mr. Utterson to look for a special box and bring it to Dr. Lanyon. 

Dr. Lanyon does this. When he meets Mr. Hyde, he's terrified. Mr. Hyde drinks the potion, and turns back into Dr. Jekyll right in front of him. 

Dr. Jekyll writes a letter to Mr. Utterson to tell him what happened. He says that the potion made his evil side come out and that he can't control it anymore.  

Mr. Utterson goes back to Dr. Jekyll's house and finds that Dr. Jekyll has disappeared. He finds Mr. Hyde's body in the room, dead from drinking the potion. 

Mr. Utterson reads Dr. Jekyll's last letter. He learns that Dr. Jekyll was trying to separate his good and bad sides. But he couldn't control his evil side, and it took over completely. Dr. Jekyll's evil side is gone, and it seems like Dr. Jekyll is gone too.  

So, the story is about how a good man's bad side took over, and how that led to a lot of sadness and trouble.
