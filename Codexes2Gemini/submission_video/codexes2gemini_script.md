Long context windows will trigger a rapid increase of speciation and taxonomic diversity in book publishing: a Cambrian Explosion.

The history of book publishing rhymes with the history of life.

- Simple organisms: the cell, the word.
- The first large organisms: Edicararean rangeomorophs, primitive codexes.
- An explosion of morphological and structural diversity: Cambrian period, codexes.
- A giant asteroid hits Earth: many phyla disappear, new ones abound (Gutenberg).
- A new evolutionary radiation: the interior form, function, ad structure evolve rapidly.
  - Mammals!
  - New parts of the book abound: busy title pages, multi-page dedications, elaborate indexes and more.
- Consolidation and rationalization occurs - a mixed blessing. .
  - Goodbye charismatic megafauna!
  - Goodbye multipage dedications, elaborate footnotes, multiple indexes, foldout maps.
- The Internet & ebooks:
  - Changes the environment, but not as badly as feared. Printed books survive, new titles abound, e-books find their niche.
- Long input and output context windows are the next asteroid that will strike book publishing.

The big idea: very long context input and output is an *adaptive event* for the world of books.  

The history of publishing rhymes with the history of life.

Next: early creatures and early codexes.
