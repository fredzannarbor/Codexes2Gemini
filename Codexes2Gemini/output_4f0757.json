"# Inventory of Parts of the Book\nContext: STORY OF THE DOOR\n\nThis document does not contain any of the parts of a book listed in the Chicago\nManual of Style 17th edition. \n\nWhile it includes a story, it lacks:\n\n* **Foreword:** An introductory piece written by someone other than the author,\n  often providing context or commentary.\n* **Dedication:** A statement expressing gratitude or affection, usually to a person\n  or group.\n* **Chapter:**  A distinct division of a book, usually marked by a number or title. \n\nThe text presented resembles a single chapter from a larger book. \n\n\nThis story is about a submarine called the R-14. It's a big, strong submarine that can travel underwater.\n\nOne day, the R-14 was sent to find a missing boat called the Conestoga. The\nConestoga was a tugboat that had been towing a barge full of coal. It had been\ngone for a long time, and the navy was worried.\n\nThe R-14 got ready to go, but they made a mistake. They thought they had\nenough fuel to last for ten days, but they didn't!\n\nThey ended up running out of fuel in the middle of the ocean. They were stuck!\nThe sailors on the R-14 were very smart, though. They knew how to use sails\non boats, so they made their own sails out of blankets and canvas. They rigged\nthem up to the masts on their submarine, and used the wind to help them sail to\nHilo, a port on another island.\n\nThey had to use the wind to power the submarine because they didn\u2019t have\nenough electricity left in their batteries. They made the sails from blankets and\ncanvas that they had on board. The R-14 was never meant to use sails, but it\nworked!\n\nIt took them a few days to get to Hilo, but they finally made it. The other sailors in the navy were very impressed that they managed to save themselves. The\nR-14 was a very brave submarine!\n\nThey found out that the Conestoga had actually sunk a long time ago in a storm\nnear California. The R-14 had been searching in the wrong place.\n\nEven though they didn't find the Conestoga, the R-14's story is an example of\nhow teamwork, creativity, and a little bit of luck can help us overcome any problem.\n\n\n\n## TLDR (three words)\n\nSubmarine sails to Hilo.\n\n## ELI5\n\nA submarine ran out of fuel in the ocean. To get back to port, the sailors used\nblankets and the boat's radio mast to make sails and sail all the way to Hilo! They\nwere smart because they thought to use something they had on board to help them.\n\n## Scientific-Style Abstract\n\nThis narrative details the unusual incident of the USS R-14 (SS-91) in 1921\nwhile conducting a search and rescue mission for the missing USS Conestoga\n(AT-54) off the coast of the Hawaiian Islands. It analyzes the historical and technical details of the event, demonstrating how simple human error led to a\nsituation that required creative thinking and problem solving by the crew. The\nnarrative outlines the specific shortcomings in leadership, oversight, and organizational procedures that led to the event, and then analyzes the actions that\nthe crew took to recover from the incident. It concludes with a discussion of the\nlessons learned from this event and how they apply to modern naval operations.\n\n\n\n## Inventory of Parts of the Book\n* Foreword\n* Preface\n* About the Authors\n* Authors' Notes & Acknowledgements \n* Abbreviations\n* Publisher's Note \n* Part 1\n* Part 2\n* Appendix A\n* Appendix B\n* Bibliography\n* Index \n\n## ELI5\nImagine a book about a submarine that got lost at sea. It\u2019s like a big, underwater car! But it ran out of fuel! \nThis book tells the story of how the submarine\u2019s crew was able to use their smarts and ingenuity to get\nhome. They even rigged up sails on their submarine, just like the sailboats you see at the beach! It\u2019s a\npretty cool story. \nThe book also has a special section at the beginning with notes from the authors explaining how they\nwrote the book and a section at the end listing all the books and papers they used to write the\nstory. There\u2019s even a glossary at the back so you can understand all the fancy words they use! \n\n## TLDR (three words)\nSubmarine sails home. \n"
