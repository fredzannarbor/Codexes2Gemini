He's friends with a doctor named Dr. Jekyll, but he's worried about Dr. Jekyll because he has a secret friend named Mr. Hyde who is very scary and makes everyone feel uncomfortable.

One day, Mr. Utterson finds out that Mr. Hyde has a key to Dr. Jekyll's house. He gets really worried because he thinks Mr. Hyde is up to no good. 

Then, one night, a really bad thing happens!  Mr. Hyde kills a nice man named Sir Carew! Everyone is shocked and tries to find Mr. Hyde, but he disappears!

Mr. Utterson and the police go to Mr. Hyde's house, and they find out that he burned a lot of papers and took a lot of money from Dr. Jekyll. They think Mr. Hyde might have stolen the money to run away.

Mr. Utterson goes back to Dr. Jekyll's house and sees that Dr. Jekyll is really sick. Dr. Jekyll tells Mr. Utterson that he's done with Mr. Hyde, but Mr. Utterson doesn't believe him.

Then, a year later, Mr. Utterson finds out that Dr. Jekyll has been locked away in his house for a long time. He goes to see his other friend, Dr. Lanyon, but Dr. Lanyon says he doesn't want to see or talk about Dr. Jekyll anymore.  

Mr. Utterson gets worried and goes back to Dr. Jekyll's house. He finds out that the servants are scared because they haven't seen Dr. Jekyll in a long time. They think something bad might have happened.

Mr. Utterson and the servants decide to break down the door to Dr. Jekyll's secret room. When they finally get inside, they find Mr. Hyde dead!  It turns out Mr. Hyde killed himself because he couldn't live with what he had done.

Mr. Utterson finds a letter from Dr. Jekyll asking him to read two stories.  The first story is from Dr. Lanyon, and the second story is from Dr. Jekyll.  They tell a very strange story: Dr. Jekyll found a magical potion that could turn him into a different person! This different person was Mr. Hyde, and he was really bad!  He did all sorts of bad things, but Dr. Jekyll didn't want to believe it because he was afraid to admit that he was also a bad person.

Dr. Jekyll tried to control Mr. Hyde, but eventually, Mr. Hyde took over and Dr. Jekyll couldn't change back.  In the end, Mr. Hyde killed himself, and Dr. Jekyll couldn't change back. It was a really sad ending!  

So the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is about the dark side of people and how it can be hard to control our own bad impulses.
