At their heart they need\npropulsion. Massive diesel engines and their associated machinery are crammed\ninto small steel hulls. This takes up around half of the space inside. Batteries, required for underwater propulsion, take up another chunk. And the fuel tanks yet\nmore. All this valuable space given over just to propelling the submarine along.\nBut what if it fails?\nThe unusual tale of R-14 verges on myth and legend. Yet it is real, as told here\nby David L. Johnston and Ric Hedman. It is a unique story, and one which is entertaining, inspirational and educational.\nToday submarine crews are drilled in safety. What to do in the event of fire,\nflooding, medical emergencies, gas and so much more is committed to memory.\nWhat to do if you run out of power in the middle of the ocean, with no communications, and only a few days of provisions, is not something you think of.\nIn 1921, the submarine was called upon to render assistance to a ship in distress. A tug boat had gone missing. Yet R-14 would herself soon become the one\nwhich needed rescuing. Finding herself without power, she drifted, dangerously\nlow on food and and hope. The ingenuity of the crew saved her, and their lives.\nThe brave tale of how they improvised to overcome a seemingly impossible situation is valuable for leaders in any domain. How a seemingly mundane task\nquickly turned deadly. And how a strong understanding of the basics allowed the\ncrew to be saved.\nThe tug boat was not so lucky.\nToday perhaps the scenario could not play out the same. The distances involved\nfeel short by modern standards. Especially with aircraft and faster submarines.\nBut the ocean is vast, and the same human qualities of resourcefulness, resolve\nand teamwork remain every bit as important. The story of R-14 is as much a human tale as a submarine fact check. It is something which everyone can relate to.\nH. I. Sutton\nNaval analyst, \u201cCovert Shores\"\nix\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nx\n\nx\n\n\fPREFACE\nThere are stories of the sea that involve bravery, perseverance, innovation, adaptation, and strength of character. Some stories highlight the foibles and fallibility of humanity, and many contain lessons for the mariner that still resonate today.\nThe saga of the submarine USS R-14 (SS-91) during a search and rescue operation off the coast of Hawaii in 1921 certainly contains all of those elements. It is a\nstory unique in the annals of the United States Navy\u2019s Submarine Service and runs\nthe gamut from simple human error to inspiring, out-of-the-box problem solving.\nPigBoats.COM webmaster and author Ric Hedman first began this story over\n10 years ago but never completed it. I have been a close friend and associate of\nRic\u2019s since 2001, assisting him with historical research and photographic analysis.\nRic asked me if I would like to take a crack at it, and after debating for quite some\ntime, I decided, with Ric\u2019s enthusiastic permission, to finish it. Much of what you\nsee in the narrative below came directly from Ric\u2019s efforts, I simply refined and\nexpanded on his earlier work.\nThe overwhelming majority of the story was lifted directly from the official Log\nBook, USS R-14, Jan. 1, 1921 to Dec. 31, 1921. We also used contemporary newspaper\narticles, navigational charts, atlases, personal accounts from the crewmembers\nand their families, and other printed material as sources. Ric and I have always\nemphasized accuracy in our work as historians, and everything that you will read\nbelow is as true to facts as we can possibly make it.\nHowever, we must insert one very large caveat: the spoken dialogue between\nthe crew was never recorded anywhere and is entirely of our own creation. All of\nthe principals in this story have long since passed so it can\u2019t be known for sure\nwhat conversations passed between these men. In order to provide the reader\nwith a personal connection to the story, we wanted to humanize it a bit and thus\nthe back-and-forth dialogue. Ric and I are both Navy veterans and qualified in\nsubmarines. Ric served on both nuclear and diesel submarines in the 1960s, and I\nserved on a diesel boat in the 1980s as part of a 21-year career that also included\ntours of duty on minesweepers and destroyers. We relied on the experience of\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nthese combined twenty-seven years of naval service to faithfully as possible recreate some of the conversations and scenes contained herein.\nA small amount of speculation occurs in other parts of the narrative. For instance, there is a passage where a sailor is discharged from the service, and a short\ntime later he re-enlisted. That event actually happened because it is documented\nin the deck log. However, the actions of the sailor and his shipmates during and\nbetween the two ceremonies is largely our informed speculation.\nThere are three main purposes to this work: 1) to tell a great and entertaining\nsea story; 2) to provide an analysis of the events to the reader so that they may\nunderstand what happened and why; and 3) to provide lessons learned to the present-day Navy in leadership, perseverance, and innovative thinking. There will\nbe points in this story in which we must adopt a tone critical to the crew, and this\nis done in order to discuss the truth of the events. Ric and I have the greatest respect and admiration for Alexander D. Douglas and the crew of the R-14, the bond\nof brotherhood to our fellow submariners being quite strong. In no way is it our\ndesire to sully the memory of anyone\u2019s family member, but in order to learn the\nlessons from this incident, it will be necessary to discuss the human mistakes that\nwere made. We treat all sailors mentioned herein with the greatest respect possible, and we would like to apologize in advance to anyone who might look askance\nat our efforts.\nThank you for reading.\nDCC(SS/SW) David L.

Johnston, USN (Ret.)\n\nA native of Dexter, MI., Chief Johnston enlisted in the Navy in September 1983.\nOver the course of a 21-year career Chief Johnston served on the USS Darter (SS576), four Mine Countermeasures ships, and the USS Forrest Sherman (DDG-98).\nHe has been on the staffs of Navy Operational Support Centers in Des Moines IA,\nBrunswick ME, Rochester NY, Battle Creek MI, and on the staff of the Supervisor\nof Shipbuilding, Bath ME. He has made four overseas deployments to Japan and\nthe western Pacific, the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and the Gulf of Aden. He retired\nfrom active duty in August, 2019.\nHis awards include the Navy Commendation Medal, Navy Achievement Medal,\nNavy Good Conduct Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary and Service\nMedals, Armed Forces Reserve Medal w/ \u201cM\u201d device, and a COMSUBGRU 7 Letter\nof Commendation. Chief Johnston is qualified in submarines and surface warfare.\nDuring a break in service in the 1990s, he worked in the travel, security, and\nretail industries.\nxiii\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nChief Johnston is the author of the Visual Guide series of articles concerning\nUS submarine identification and two of his articles on submarine history have\nbeen published by the Naval Submarine League in The Submarine Review. He is\na team member with the Lost 52 Project as a research historian, and is an editor of\nthe project\u2019s quarterly newsletter. Chief Johnston is the co-founder of the website\nPigBoats.COM and has been a contributor to the US Naval Institute\u2019s Proceedings\nmagazine. He is a volunteer photo analyst and researcher for Navsource.org. He\nresides in Norfolk, Virginia with his wife Theresa.\n\nRIC HEDMAN\n\nFigure 2. TN(SS) Richard C. Hedman, USN\n\nBorn and raised in the state of Washington, Ric was primarily brought up in\nthe Seattle area. After high school graduation in 1964 he enlisted in the Navy and\nattended boot camp and \u201cA\u201d school in San Diego, CA where he volunteered for\nduty in submarines. After attending Submarine School at Submarine Base New\nLondon in Groton CT in 1965, he was assigned to the pre-commissioning crew of\nthe Thresher class submarine USS Flasher (SSN-613), under construction at General Dynamics/Electric Boat in Groton, CT. After commissioning Flasher changed\nhomeports to Hawaii, and from there Ric deployed on numerous patrols to the\nnorthern, western and central Pacific. After slightly over four years on active\nduty, he transitioned to the Navy Reserve and was assigned to the Submarine Reserve Unit in Seattle, where he completed his six-year military obligation. During\nxiv\n\nxiv\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nthis period, he performed temporary duty on the diesel submarine USS Cusk (SS348), shortly before her decommissioning.\nHis service awards include the Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation Ribbon,\nNavy Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, and the Korean Defense Service Medal. He is qualified in submarines.\nWhile in civilian life he worked in various professions, learning skills that later\nserved him well. An avid sailor, he operated his own business performing yacht\nand small boat repair, and lived on and operated his own sailboat for ten years.\nTransitioning jobs once again, he spent 14 years in the Bio-Tech industry in the\nMaterials Management role, taking several companies from their startup phases\ninto Food & Drug Administration-approved production of their products.\nDuring this time Ric developed a passion for the early history of the submarine\nservice and began producing a small web page about that era, learning as he went\nalong. This culminated in the creation of PigBoats.COM with author and historian\nDavid Johnston. Along the way he has collaborated with numerous authors on\nsubmarine history matters, serving as a technical advisor on approximately a\ndozen books and manuscripts. He is a member of the local Seattle base of the\nUnited States Submarine Veterans, Inc. and has been its Base Commander on\nthree different occasions. He resides in Mountlake Terrace, WA.\n\nxv\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nAUTHORS\u2019 NOTES & ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nDAVE\nOne lazy summer afternoon when I was eight years old, I found myself bored,\nso I starting perusing my father\u2019s book collection looking for something to pass\nthe time. There I found a first edition copy of On The Bottom, written in 1929 by\nEdward Ellsberg. It was the story of the sinking and salvage of the submarine USS\nS-51 (SS-162) in 1925 and 1926. I found it utterly fascinating and I quickly read it\nfrom cover to cover. I didn\u2019t fully understand it at first, as there were some advanced technical stuff in it, but it proved to be the genesis of a life-long fascination\nwith the sea and submarines. It lead me to join the Navy in 1983 and volunteer for\nsubmarine service. That early fascination stayed with me throughout my service\nand in later years. I became a devoted historian, with On The Bottom becoming a\nvalued member of my library.\nRic Hedman was the original author of this work. He completed the majority of\nthe research and wrote about thirty-two pages of narrative before experiencing a\nsevere case of writer\u2019s block. I have been working with Ric as a partner on the web\npage PigBoats.COM for twenty years, and one day a few years back Ric approached\nme about finishing the story, which I found fascinating. Still on active duty with\nthe Navy at the time, the project had to wait for my retirement and the completion\nof two other projects before I was able to give it the attention that it deserved. I\ntook Ric\u2019s initial narrative and greatly expanded on it. Ric and I shared hundreds\nof phone calls and emails by the time of publication as we worked on the project,\nand we equally share in the content of this work, of which we are very proud.\nRoy Trent Gallemore\u2019s family have been key contributors of information. The\nwillingness of Roy\u2019s grandchildren and great grandchildren Bruce Gallemore, Roy\nA. Smith, and Katie Eliot to help us and provide insights into their grandfather\u2019s\nhistory and character were a key to success. We would like to pass on to them our\nsincere thanks and appreciation.\n\nxvi\n\nxvi\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nNoted historian Jim Christley provided background information on the technical aspects of the R-class submarines and his willing assistance is greatly appreciated. His illustrations greatly enhance our work, and for that we are very grateful. Michael Mohl, the webmaster of the submarine pages at Navsource.org, contributed photos and his pages provided very useful research. Author William Tidd\ntook information from the logs and meticulously created the graphic in Part One\nthat shows the R-14\u2019s track. My wife Theresa Street was my editor and coach. Her\nhelp, encouragement, and guidance were of inestimable value.\nLastly, to Alexander Dean Douglas, Roy Trent Gallemore, Harry Woodworth,\nand the entire 1921 crew of the R-14, Ric and I would like to express our admiration\nand gratitude for the lessons in perseverance, innovative thinking, and seamanship. We hope that through this narrative you will not be forgotten.\nDCC(SS/SW) David L. Johnston, USN (Ret.)\u2014August 2021\n\nRIC\nWithout the tremendous assistance of Dave Johnston, this work would never\nhave seen the light of day. I knew when writing it I didn\u2019t have the right line of\nattack on the story and I had wanted it to be more than I had been able to come up\nwith.\nThe story began years prior when I was just starting the web page \u201cThrough\nthe Looking Glass\u201d, which later morphed into PigBoats.COM. In about 2000, along\nwith my local submarine veterans\u2019 group, we made a visit to the USS Alabama\n(SSBN-731) when she visited Seattle. In the Chief\u2019s Mess, I saw a framed copy of\nthe famous photo of the R-14 under sail. I was fascinated with it and it proved to\nbe an inspiration. A few years later I was contacted by Robert Suess, son of Raymond Suess, who had been aboard the R-14 during the incident and had gotten\nhimself immortalized as the man standing in the foreground of the sailing photo.\nRobert Suess had no one in his family who wanted his dad\u2019s submarine photo collection (many crew and interior images) and wanted to know if I was interested\nin having them. I quickly agreed. This collection included an original print of a\npublic domain photo that resides in the National Archives. I estimated that there\nwere approximately twenty prints of this photo made after they returned to port,\nwith the intention of giving one to any crewmember that wanted one. One copy\neventually made it to the National Archives. Suess kept his print for many years\nxvii\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nand even took steps to preserve it by encasing it in an early form of lamination.\nThere was no doubt this was a prized family possession. It is now framed and\nhangs on my wall. Thus began my quest for the full story.\nI worked as much of it as I could for a number of years, getting all the research\nthat could be found from various sources. I soon reached a wall knowing there was\nmore, but I was at a loss as to the direction that needed to be taken. I tucked it away\nonly to repeatedly take it out and toy with it. Dave and I had talked about it over\nthe years. Finally, a decision was reached and the research materials and notebooks were packed and the whole works shipped to Dave. He has taken the story\ninto the direction where it needed to go, and I\u2019m pleased to no end with the results.\nThere is undoubtedly more to the story but after a century has passed, people and\nresources have about come to their end. The COVID pandemic also made further\ninformation-gathering problematic. I\u2019m hoping that another historian will eventually come up with something we missed and shine the light on a new angle. This,\nfor now, is about as far as we can take it.\nIt was tough and Dave was a steadying force. With both of us being Qualified\nSubmariners we are trained to know and understand the boat\u2019s operations to the\nextent that we can operate them in total darkness. We wanted to know the \u201cwhy\u201d\nand found that keeping on track proved difficult at times. We hope you like the\nresult.\nAlong with the acknowledgments given by Dave, I\u2019d like to include Raymond\nSuess and his family, especially his son Robert, for gifting the whole set of photos\nto a complete stranger and making this wonderful story possible.\nTN(SS) Ric Hedman, USN\u2014August 2021\n\nxviii\n\nxviii\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nABBREVIATIONS\nBQ\n\nBethlehem Quincy\n\nCO\n\nCommanding Officer\n\nCOB\n\nChief of the Boat\n\nCPO\n\nChief Petty Officer\n\nEB\n\nElectric Boat\n\nNOAA\n\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n\nOOD\n\nOfficer-of the Deck\n\nNELSECO\n\nNew London Ship and Engine Company\n\nNHHC\n\nNaval History and Heritage Command\n\nSUBDIV\n\nSubmarine Division\n\nxix\n\n\f\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nPUBLISHER\u2019S NOTE\nThe port city of Hilo on the Big Island of Hawaii plays an important role in this\nstory as R-14\u2019s emergency destination.

Gann\n\n\f\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nMONDAY, 02 MAY 1921, 8:00 A.M.\n\n1\n\nIt is a beautiful day in the United States Territory of Hawaii. It is a still relatively cool 76\u00ba F, with a casual southeast breeze of five miles per hour keeping the\noppressive humidity manageable at this early point in the day. Along the south\nshore of the isle of Oahu the breeze is creating small wavelets with glassy crests\nnot yet breaking. The wind is slowly pushing some tenuous cotton puff altocumulus clouds off into the northern Pacific. With the barometer holding steady at\n29.90, there are the makings of a fine day here in this Polynesian/American tropical paradise.2\nThe mouth of Pearl Harbor cuts north from the south shore, with the channel\nforming the trunk of an odd-shaped tree as it moves up and spreads out into seven\nsmaller bays, known to the Navy as lochs. The large central East Loch is broken\ninto north and south channels by the oblong-shaped Ford Island. Once the site of\na sugar cane plantation, it is now the home of the Army Air Corps Luke Field and\nthe brand-new Naval Air Station Pearl Harbor, its seaplane ramps and hangars\nlocated at the island\u2019s southeast corner. On the shallow and muddy water within\nthe harbor, a place revered by the native Hawaiian people and known to be a\nbirthplace for hammerhead sharks, barely a ripple disturbs the surface, A portion\nof the United States Navy\u2019s Pacific Fleet is present on this day.\nA small but growing base was established here in 1905 as a coaling station for\nthe Pacific Fleet ships, and steady work since then expanded the base considerably, supplanting the facilities in nearby Honolulu. The Navy Yard was established\nalong the south channel adjacent to Ford Island and it contained a hospital, a large\ndrydock (with three more planned), a foundry, numerous factory-style workshops and warehouses, and several repair basins and piers. The fleet itself was not\nyet based here, but its ships made regular port calls during fleet maneuvers. Most\n\nIn May, 1921 the USN had not yet adopted the 24-hour clock. All times in the ship\u2019s log are in the\n12-hour format, so we will adhere to that standard here.\n2\nAstronomical and weather data was compiled from published information from the Astronomical\nApplications Dept., U.S. Naval Observatory, Washington, D.C., and from the R-14 log.\n1\n\n1\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nof the ships actually stationed at the base consisted of patrol craft, auxiliaries and\nyard craft, and a contingent of the Pacific Fleet\u2019s submarines.\nThe site chosen for Submarine Base Pearl Harbor is on the east side of the harbor, at the intersection of Magazine Loch and Quarry Loch. It sits on sandy land\novergrown with tropical scrub brush and prickly cactus, and is just southeast and\na stone\u2019s throw from a small marshy islet called Kuahua. Two finger piers protrude out into Southeast Loch from the triangular-shaped base, and a narrowgauge rail line connecting the small base to the larger nearby Navy Yard meanders\nsouth along the shore of Quarry Loch. The base was willed into existence through\nthe discipline and determination of its first Commanding Officer (CO), Commander Chester W. Nimitz, and through the gritty hard work of four loyal and\nearnest Chief Petty Officers (CPOs) on his staff, who at times resorted to less than\ncompletely honest methods to acquire the scarce materials and assistance needed\nto build the base in this remote paradise.3\nSubmarine Division 14, consisting of 10 R-class submarines, calls the base\nhome. The division is headquartered on the old and inoperative cruiser USS Chicago (CA-14) moored nearby at a narrow pier at the opening of Magazine Loch. The\nR-class submarines were designed and built during the First World War as coastal\npatrol boats, with a mission to range out from American bases, patrolling for any\npotential enemy that may approach the coastline. Despite their status as coastal\nboats, these submarines are among the largest and most capable in use by the USN\nin the early 1920s. They are 186 feet long and eighteen feet wide, with a displacement of 574 tons surfaced and 685 tons submerged. Twin NELSECO 6-EB-14 diesel\nengines drive them at 12.5 knots surfaced, and when submerged, large storage\nbatteries provide power to drive electric motors providing a maximum speed of\n9.3 knots. There are four 21-inch torpedo tubes forward and each boat carried\neight torpedoes. For surface action there is a 3\u201d/50 caliber Mk 6 gun mounted on\nthe forward deck. They are outfitted for three officers and twenty-seven crew and\nare rated for 30 days at sea.\nThis day is a busy one, and the finger piers are buzzing with activity. The USS\nR-14 (SS-91) is moored alongside sister boat R-11 at Pier 1. The day\u2019s Duty Officer\naboard R-14 is Lieutenant Alexander Dean Douglas, USN, a short and compact,\ndark-haired, lean-faced native of Iowa. Douglas is a competent, well-regarded,\nand affable officer who to family and friends is known simply as \u201cDean.\u201d He is\n3\n\n2\n\nNimitz, E.B. Potter, 1976, page 132-134.\n2\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nofficially the boat\u2019s Executive Officer, or second in command; however, for the last\nseveral months he has also been designated as the Acting Commanding Officer.\nDue to a shortage of qualified officers at this remote duty station, the boat\u2019s official\nCO, Lieutenant Vincent A. Clarke, Jr., has been pulled away for temporary duty as\nthe Engineering Officer for SUBDIV 14. The division\u2019s CO, Commander Nimitz,\n(with additional responsibilities as the CO of Chicago and the Sub Base) has pulled\nClarke to his staff in order to ensure that all of his division\u2019s boats are getting the\nrepairs and maintenance necessary to be fully operational. Nimitz makes the unusual choice of pulling Clarke from the R-14 without a relief in place because of the\noverriding need to fill the division\u2019s gapped Engineering Officer billet. Both Nimitz and Clarke are confident that the younger Douglas can handle the boat; indeed,\nif necessary, Clarke is readily available to look over Douglas\u2019ss shoulder, review\nhis actions, and provide advice. When more officers become available, Nimitz retains the option of officially promoting Douglas to CO and bringing in an ensign to\nround out the R-14\u2019s officer billets, or getting the boat a new CO if Douglas needs\nmore time to season. So far, Douglas has been performing brilliantly.\nThe last bugle notes of \u201cCarry On\u201d fade away after morning colors and Douglas\npresides over the crew mustered for quarters on the pier. With the men lined up\nneatly by division in front of him, he waits patiently as the muster roll call is performed. All are present and accounted for, the only exception being a sailor who\nis still in the base hospital. Orders for the day are read and work schedules and\nassignments are given out. The senior enlisted man on the boat is Chief Gunner\u2019s\nMate (Torpedo) Harry Woodworth of Omaha. In his job as Chief of the Boat, or\nCOB, Woodworth is the Captain\u2019s get-it-done man. After conferring with Douglas\nand the other Department Heads, he is put in charge of the day\u2019s work. Once the\ncrew has been dismissed, they turn-to and begin cleaning, repairing, painting,\nand taking garbage to the containers on the pier. Bedding has been brought topside and is airing over the wire lifelines.\nA small ceremony is conducted on the pier at 10:00 a.m. by Douglas, to discharge Machinist Mate 1st class Hugh McNamara from his enlistment in the Navy.\nWith most of the crew engaged in vital ship\u2019s work, the ceremony is mostly attended by his division work mates. Naval regulations require that a sailor be officially discharged at the end of his enlistment before any further career action can\nbe taken.

EMERGENCY ORDERS AND HURRIED PREPARATIONS\nThe offices of Rear Admiral William R. Shoemaker, Commandant, Fourteenth\nNaval District at Pearl Harbor have been alive with activity since very early that\nmorning. Word arrives that the Navy fleet tug USS Conestoga (AT-54) with fiftysix men aboard and towing a coal barge is overdue for arrival and considered\nmissing. The Conestoga was en route from San Francisco to American Samoa, with\norders there for duty as the station ship. After confirmatory messages have been\nreceived from California, it is now clear she is at least a day overdue for a fueling\nstop in Pearl Harbor. Shoemaker\u2019s staff have been busy since early this morning,\nsetting up a search and rescue plan and drafting orders for all fifteen ships assigned to the district and to others in tenant commands to get underway immediately. Word is sent to the SUBDIV 14 offices, kicking Nimitz\u2019s staff into action. At\neleven o\u2019clock preparations are complete and Nimitz issues orders to submarines\nunder his command to prepare to get under way for a ten-day deployment to\nsearch for the missing Conestoga, beginning no later than sunset that same day.\nThe R-11, R-14, R-18 and R-19 are able to respond to the orders and begin readying\nfor sea. The R-12 is undergoing a refit at the shipyard and is unable to get underway. The remaining boats of the division are in various states of repair and unable\nto get underway either. Nimitz decides to go along to oversee operations, and\nsince the Chicago is incapable of getting underway, he chooses as his flagship the\nsurface patrol craft USS Eagle No. 14 (PE-14)4. Nimitz and his division are assigned\na plum area east of the Big Island of Hawaii, along the probable route the Conestoga\nwould be taking on her approach to the islands. Confidence is high that if she is\nstill afloat, the submarines of Division 14 will find her.\nNimitz\u2019s flagship for this operation is an odd duck. One of Henry Ford\u2019s \u201cEagle\u201d\npatrol craft, the Eagle No. 14 was part of a wartime emergency shipbuilding program designed to quickly get craft into the water to fight off the scourge of the\nGerman U-boats. Lacking adequate shipyard space to build large numbers of craft\nneeded, the United States Shipping Board, acting under direct orders from President Wilson, recruited automobile magnate Henry Ford to join the board in an\nLog Book, USS Eagle #14, Jan. 1, 1921 to Dec. 31, 1921, page 250.\n14\n14\n\n4\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nattempt to solve the problem. Ford took on the challenge and had his engineers\ndraw up the design for a simple, easily produced ocean going patrol vessel that\ncould be built by his auto engineers and workers in Detroit. He emphasized simplicity, so the engineers eliminated curves, keeping everything at right angles.\nThe result was a leaky, slab-sided, boxy looking, sloped deck monstrosity with\nmeager sea keeping qualities, but Ford was able to turn them out quickly at a plant\nestablished on the River Rouge near Detroit. The \u201cEagle Boats\u201d, as they were\ncalled, were actually too late to enter combat in WWI, but most served with the\nNavy and Coast Guard through the 1920s, some as late as 1945.\nEnergized now by the emergency underway orders, the crews on the division\u2019s\nsubmarines stop all routine work and immediately begin underway preparations.\nThe finger piers become a whirlwind of activity, bluejackets and officers frantically working to meet the deadline. The air charge on the R-14 is stopped at 11:05\nand fresh water is taken on board, filling the submarine\u2019s fresh water storage\ntanks. The total fresh water aboard is now at 900 gallons, 200 of which has been\nfurther purified for battery water. The Quartermasters pull the charts for the assigned operation area, reviewing them and ensuring that they are corrected and\nup-to-date. Pre-underway checklists are pulled out and started. There is a lot to\ndo and little time to get it done.\nA major concern is fuel. The R-class boats have a normal and reserve fuel capacity of 10,383 gallons, spread out over seven fuel tanks located under the walking decks in the torpedo and engine rooms.5 The ship\u2019s logs indicate that she has\n6,978 gallons currently onboard. Normal pre-underway procedure is to sound the\nfuel tanks to verify that number. However, pressed by time, it is decided to accept\nthe log numbers at face value and forgo sounding the tanks. Given that information, for a ten-day underway, it is determined that a trip to the fuel dock will\nbe necessary to take on additional fuel.6\nHaving been in port for several weeks, there is little food on board any of the\nboats. Food stores ordered early that morning by the division begin arriving at the\nChicago to be distributed to the deploying boats.

PROVISIONS AND FUEL\nAt noon, Douglas holds another small ceremony on the pier, dictated by Navy\nprotocol. Going against the good-natured ribbing of his shipmates, crewman\nMcNamara, having rammed through the paperwork with the division yeoman,\nraises his right hand and swears the oath of enlistment, agreeing to another four\nyears of duty in the United States Navy and aboard submarines. As soon as the\nshort re-enlistment ceremony concludes, the maneuvering watch is stationed and\nlines are singled up and cast off. The R-14 neatly backs out of her slip, bends her\nstern to the left, then executes a sharp right-hand turn to point herself out to the\nSouth Channel near Ford Island. She is heads out of the harbor on both shafts but\nrunning just the port engine.\nShe is heading to an area outside the entrance to Pearl Harbor identified as\nArea #6 to blow fuel tanks. This is the first part of the process to bring fuel on\nboard. She arrives in this area at 1:00 p.m. and comes to all stop. In a procedure\nusing high-pressure air, all fuel tanks are pressurized and emptied of the oily\ncompensation water at the bottom of the tanks. Fuel tanks are kept full of either\nfuel or water to prevent their collapse under pressure when submerged and to\nmaintain proper ballast and trim. With fuel being lighter than water, the tanks\nthat still have fuel are blown until a sheen of diesel fuel begins to spread on the\nwater\u2019s surface, indicating that any water in the bottom of the tanks is gone. This\nperiod between blowing the tanks and taking on fuel is the only time the tanks\nhave air in them, because the boat will be on the surface the entire time. Once the\nblow is completed the tanks are vented to ambient pressure so that they may be\nfilled. This evolution is completed by 1:31 p.m., and R-14 is underway on the port\nengine alone, headed back to the base.\nR-14 moors up to Pier 2 near the Chicago about twenty minutes later and sets up\nto load her food and other stores waiting for her on the pier. Although the anticipated underway time is ten days, enough food for fourteen days has been ordered\nas a contingency. \u201cAll hands topside to load stores,\u201d is the word passed through\nthe boat by Chief Woodworth. The crew comes topside through deck hatches and\nform a line from the stack of provisions on the pier to the hatch forward of the\n19\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nconning tower fairwater. Men are even on the ladder and down below to handle\nthe supplies. With the hatches being only twenty-four inches in diameter, most of\nthe crates and boxes have to be opened topside and the items contained therein\nlowered or dropped one at a time down the hatch to sailors waiting below to stow\nthem. As all sailors are wont to do, the crew grumbles and grouses as the task is\nperformed, but privately they are very appreciative at the quantity and quality of\nthe food they receive.\nWe do not have the actual list of food that the R-14 took aboard but there is a list\nof food loaded by the R-198 and an assumption can be made that R-14 took aboard a\nsimilar load of stores. It is illustrative of the variety of food they had, and to how\nmuch even a small crew of sailors can consume:\nTable 1.

Food storage lockers are tightly packed. Finally, garbage and other unnecessary materials are taken ashore and placed in garbage bins\nlined at the head of the pier. The boat is swept down and made shipshape under\nWoodworth\u2019s watchful eye. The maneuvering watch is set again and the boat\nbacks out, headed to the fuel dock.\nThe fuel dock has been a busy place all day with vessels needing to top off before heading to sea. Nimitz\u2019s flagship Eagle No. 14 moored to the dock at 12:15 p.m.\nand at 12:20 the minesweeper Seagull (AM-30) moors alongside. Four more Eagle\nboats assigned to the Naval District are also present, and at 1:40 p.m. the R-19\nmoored outboard of Seagull.\nTwenty minutes after shoving off from Pier 2, R-14 ties up at the fuel dock (Fig.\n8). The engine room crew comes topside and brings over the heavy rubber fuel\nhoses, connecting them to the fueling connections inside the forward and aft superstructure. After verifying the valve lineup below, word is passed to the dock\nthat all is ready and the final valve on the dock is opened. As the fueling proceeds,\nvalve lineups below are changed and the oncoming fuel is directed to each tank\nthat needs it. Based on the information in the previous day\u2019s logs, the process stops\nwhen 3318 gallons of fuel is received, the crew confident that that they now have\n21\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\n10,296 gallons of fuel onboard. Recorded performance data shows that given the\nconditions in which the R-14 is expected to be steaming, she will use about 840\ngallons of fuel each day; 10,296 gallons should provide them at least a 19% safety\nmargin.\nOr so they think.\n\nFigure 14.

The fueling hoses are returned to the pier, and the\nfuel system aboard the boat is lined up for immediate use. The maneuvering watch\nis set and she shoves off from the dock and stands down the channel, proudly the\nfirst unit of SUBDIV 14 to get underway for the search. At 5:20 she is followed by\nthe R-18. The Eagle No. 14 with Nimitz, his mess attendant, and his adjutant aboard\nshoves off at 5:30 with Nimitz\u2019s personal flag flapping in the breeze. R-11 and R-19\ndepart five minutes later, falling into the Tail-end Charlie position.\nAboard the R-14, the boat\u2019s only other assigned officer, Lieutenant Roy Trent\nGallemore, is standing watch on the bridge as Officer of the Deck. Gallemore, a\nnative of Bartow, Florida, is tall, lean, and fit with a rounded, handsome face. A\npious man, he reads his Bible every night and rarely if ever uses swear words. A\nvalued member of the Naval Academy fencing team (a sporting interest he shares\nwith Douglas), Gallemore maintains an athletic physique but conversely has a\nreputation of being quite the chow hound, renowned for his ability to eat all that\nis in front of him, in part earning him the nickname \u201cBeanie\u201d at the Academy.\nAbove all else, he has earned recognition as being an intelligent and capable officer, and he and Douglas work well together. Like Douglas, he is \u201cmulti-hatted\u201d\nin his assignment to the boat. In addition to being the acting Executive Officer, he\nis also the Chief Engineer, the Electrical Officer, and the Commissary Officer.\nThe bridge is a small structure that sits on top of the conning tower fairwater,\nitself a free-flooding sheet metal structure that surrounds the vertical cylinder of\nthe watertight conning tower, and it sits very nearly amidships. The conning\ntower itself is about the size of three phone booths jammed together, and contains\na magnetic compass repeater display and a station for using #1 periscope. Around\nthe periphery of the upper part of the conning tower are six small non-opening\nporthole-style deadlights that allow an occupant of the conning tower to see out.\nAt the very top is the watertight hatch leading to the bridge itself.\nThe bridge is a semi-circular sheet metal structure designed to provide the\nbridge watch standers some level of protection from the wind and sea spray. It is\nsometimes referred to as a \u201cchariot bridge\u201d because it resembles an ancient open\nchariot in shape.\n24\n24\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nPrior to World War I, this was a pipe and canvas affair that took time to take\napart and stow below before the sub could dive. Once the US entered the war, it\nwas seen how unpractical this was and the USN copied contemporary British and\nGerman permanent bridge design ideas. It became the default for all later USN designs.\nThe bridge area is small and cramped, providing barely enough room for Gallemore and his lookouts to stand, their backs against the vertical steel tubes of the\nperiscope shears. Directly in front of them at the forward end of the bridge is the\nmagnetic compass binnacle with its steel compensating spheres on each side, a\nvoice tube used for communications with watch standers below also attached to\nthe binnacle. The bridge hatch is normally the only hatch to remain open while\nsurfaced to facilitate the comings and goings of the bridge watch standers. It also\nspeeds the process of vacating the bridge if the boat has to be submerged quickly.\nThe SUBDIV 14 vessels spread out once they left the harbor, each heading to a\ndifferent sector east of the Big Island. The R-14 is to search an area between lines\ndrawn at 104\u00b0 and 134\u00b0 true from Diamond Head Light as a center. This is a pieshaped wedge of sea fanning out to the southeast of the Big Island of Hawaii. Douglas lays out a square shaped grid pattern within this zone, with its center about\n100 miles off shore. His intention is to search the square by running parallel tracks\nback and forth, akin to a pattern of \u201cmowing the lawn\u201d. Once out of the Pearl Harbor channel and clear of buoy #1, a course is set of 141\u00b0 true, engine speed of 320\nRPM, good for maintaining a speed of eleven knots. This course takes them south\nof the island chain, running southeast until they round Ka Lae Point, the Big Island\u2019s south cape. At that point they turn due east until they reach the search area.\nThe crew is relaxed and confident, glad that the maddening frustrations of the\nemergency underway are past and they are once again at sea where a sailor should\nbe. The only edge to their attitude is the knowledge that the crew of the Conestoga\ncould be in a bad way, so their amenable mood is tempered somewhat by the urgency of their mission. The wind is out of the southeast at a gentle two knots and\nan almost mirror-like sea is running. When all things were considered, it was a\ngood day to be underway.\nShortly after clearing the harbor, the maneuvering watch is secured and the\nnormal underway watch, section one is set. Two new lookouts come topside to the\nbridge, one with a much-welcomed cup of coffee for Gallemore. The officer\nwatches with approval as the two off going lookouts pass on to their reliefs the\ntopside navigation picture, and once complete he granted his permission for the\n25\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nwatch to be relieved. The off going men quickly scamper below for some coffee\nand hot chow. Normally, Gallemore would have been relieved as well. But since\nthere are only two qualified officers on board, he and Douglas are standing \u201cPort\nand Starboard\u201d watches, normally meaning four hours on watch and four hours\noff. However, for this underway they decide to do things a little differently, and\nthe two men prearrange for Gallemore to retain the watch until midnight. This\nallows Douglas to get some sleep prior to watch. At 7:00 p.m. the officer\u2019s mess\nattendant brings a plate of hot food up to the bridge to a grateful Gallemore, as his\nstomach was rumbling uncomfortably.\nThe men coming on watch wear jackets to keep them warm against the coming\nnight chill. In the tropics there is little or no twilight, and the increased wind speed\nof four to six knots after night fall, along with the added perceived eleven knots of\nwind created by the boat\u2019s forward momentum, made for fifteen knots of wind\nchill. It will be an uncomfortable night if you come topside unprepared.\nThe evening grows rapidly shorter as the sun plunges into the sea behind the\nsubmarine. The sun finally sets and the notoriously short tropical twilight is gone\nby 7:30. The growing night is starry with only a light cover of altocumulus clouds.\nDarkness is almost complete. The Milky Way comes into focus in the darkening\nsky as a glittering path across the black night. The waning crescent moon, barely\nvisible during the day, has gone down while the R-14 was still loading provisions.\nIn the northern sky the huge W of Cassiopeia's throne lays on its side. Low in the\nnorthwest touching the horizon, the Andromeda galaxy, a pale fuzzy dot, is at the\nedge of visibility as it dives into the sea. Low to the west Orion still fights his eternal battle with Taurus. Bright Spica glitters diamond-like as she rises in the east\nand above her, mammoth Arcturus shows a ruddy gold high ahead in the eastern\nsky. These heavenly wonders all make a faint, ghostly light on the smooth seas.\nThe light in the compass binnacle casts a faint red glow on Gallemore\u2019s face as he\nverifies that the helmsman is holding the assigned course. The water hisses as it\npasses the hull, the ghostly green glow sparkles in the wake as the steady heavy\nthrob of the NELSECO diesels pushes the submarine southeast into the night, the\nperpetual signature cloud of white exhaust only faintly visible in the darkness.\nAt 11:30 p.m., exactly to Navy standards and tradition, Lieutenant Douglas\ncomes up to the bridge and begins the process of letting his eyes adjust to the darkness, and to receive the watch turnover from Gallemore. Douglas receives status\nreports on all equipment, gets updates on the boat\u2019s course, speed, and current\n26\n26\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nposition, and chats with the lookouts as to the status of all contacts, which in this\ncase there are none. The horizon is clear. Precisely at 11:45 Douglas turned to Gallemore, and formally states, \u201cI relieve you, sir.\u201d\n\u201cI stand relieved,\u201d Gallemore replies. \u201cPermission to go below?\u201d\n\u201cGranted.\u201d Douglas feels a sense of satisfaction with Gallemore\u2019s performance\ntoday because he made the best of that pre-underway mess. He gives Gallemore a\nquick nod in acknowledgment and Gallemore smiles briefly at the unspoken compliment. He then scuttles down the hatch, the vision of a quick snack and a warm\nbunk dancing in his head.\n\n27\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nFigure 16.Ensign Roy Trent Gallemore early in his career, on the forecastle of the USS Des\nMoines (Cruiser #15), circa 1919.

He and his lookouts continuously\nscan the horizon for contacts as they listen to the melodic thrum of the powerful\ndiesels. At 2:25 a.m. Douglas orders a 100-ampere float battery charge, a procedure to keep the batteries fully topped off and ready to go in case they need to\nsubmerge. Below in the after battery compartment, the electrician on watch\nmakes the shift in the switches that turns the electric motors into generators and\nconnects them to the battery circuits. He watches the volt meter and adjusts the\ncurrent flow.\nBelow decks, the rest of the crew not on watch settles into normal at-sea routine. Many of those not on watch are sleeping in their bunks in the forward battery compartment and the torpedo room. Senior men are assigned to a three-high,\nstacked metal frame bunk, while the junior men sling Navy-issue hammocks from\nthe overhead. Shoes are tucked into corners of the bunks and standard Navy-issue\nwhite cotton sheets are casually draped across the men. Because it is the tropics,\nthe inside of the riveted hull is damp and the few fans that move air are blowing\nstale air around.\nThose not sleeping or on watch are doing what sailors do at sea, drinking coffee\nfrom the bottomless coffeepot and telling barely believable sea stories, trying to\nout-do each other\u2019s tale with one equally outlandish. Some read books or magazines or play acey-deucy. Others, mostly new men, trace systems and follow pipes,\ntaking voluminous notes. These \u201cNubs\u201d or \u201cNon-quals\u201d are trying to complete a\nprocess that earns them the designation Qualified in Submarine Torpedo Boat\nWork, with the highly-prized entry made into their service records. This status is\nvalued not only because of the extra money that the designation holds, but because it brings them into the brotherhood of submariners, an elite status within\nthe Navy. They sit pretty much anywhere they can find a surface to hold them, or\non the decks and lockers, their voices hushed in respect of sleeping shipmates.\n\n33\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nSince the submarine is on the surface only three men need to be on watch in\nthe control room. One is the quartermaster, Douglas\u2019ss principal navigation assistant; another the duty electrician, who divided his time between the motor controllers and power rheostats in the control room and the massive switchboards in\nthe next compartment aft, and the third, the helmsman at the main helm wheel.\nThe room is darkened, with red lights glowing to add an eerie look, the darkened\nspace assisting in setting the night vision of those about to go up to the bridge\nThe compartment just aft of the control room is called the after battery. Onehalf of the boat\u2019s huge storage battery is under the deck. (The other half was under\nthe deck in the compartment forward of the control room, under the crew\u2019s and\nofficer\u2019s berthing spaces.) This space is also where the ship\u2019s galley is located,\nalong with the portable tables and benches where the crew eat. The night baker is\nbusy in the galley baking up sticky buns, biscuits, pies, and other goodies for the\nnext day\u2019s consumption. A non-rated seaman assisting the cooks sits at one of the\ntables in the crew\u2019s mess and peels potatoes, getting them ready for cooking on\nthe boat\u2019s large electric range. They will be fried with butter on the range\u2019s grill\nmaking home fries to go with eggs, bacon and maybe some of the infamous bully\nbeef, known by many as corned beef. Four meals are served each day: breakfast,\nlunch, dinner, and midnight rations, also known as \u201cmid-rats\u201d or \u201csoup-down\u201d.\nSoup, bread, cold cuts, and hard-boiled eggs are made available to the crews going\non and coming off watch at midnight. A huge urn of hot coffee is available twentyfour hours a day.\nThere is little compensation that can be offered to the crew of a submarine to\nmake up for small, cramped, damp spaces, and good food is one way of doing this.\nYet in 1921 there still isn\u2019t an effective means of keeping fresh food and meats\naboard for long periods. Refrigeration plants are a very new technology and too\nlarge for these small subs so iceboxes were used and not always effectively or successfully. Food spoilage is a constant concern. The R-14 received an allotment of\nseveral hundred pounds of the ice prior to getting underway and this has served\nto mitigate spoilage somewhat.\n03 May 1921 dawns on a glassy sea with long, low swells and a stippling of\nclouds that cover about 40 percent of the sky, white against an otherwise blue Hawaiian sky. Once the boat arrives in the search square, they begin the laborious\nprocess of sweeping the sea, on the lookout for any signs of the missing Conestoga\nand her fifty-six crewmen. Back and forth they \u201cmow the lawn\u201d in the search area;\n34\n34\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nthe Officer of the Deck and the lookouts constantly straining to pick up even the\nslightest hint of their missing shipmates. The men turn down the brims of their\nwhite hats to afford some level of protection to their faces and ears from the relentless sun and to give shade to the eyes squinting at the highly reflective glitter\nof the sea\u2019s surface. Hour after hour this goes on. Men give relief to their eyes and\narms by lowering the glasses and blinking quickly; some rub their tired eyes. They\nthen shake and flex their arms to restore circulation and relieve muscle cramps.\nThey twist necks to try and pop out kinks, lick their lips and once more raise the\nglasses to look for any sign of their brother sailors alone on this huge sea.\nSometimes the boat runs on one engine, sometimes both. For several hours\neach night the boat comes to all stop and \u201clays to\u201d, or just drifts. This is done so\nthat they will not accidentally miss the Conestoga in the black of night and sail\nright on past. As morning twilight appears, they get underway again for the active\nsearch. Battery charges are started and completed, and occasional minor repairs\nto equipment are conducted, with the high-pressure air compressors seeming to\nbe a constant headache.\nOminously, there are several occasions when the engines begin to run roughly.\nTroubleshooting finds water in the fuel, and clearing this condition requires the\nboat to come to all stop and drift until the fuel lines were flushed and the condition\ncorrected. With the sub rolling gently in the long, smooth Pacific swells the men\nsweat in the stiflingly hot atmosphere of the 15-foot diameter, tapering confines\nof the engine room. The diesels are too hot to touch after hours of continuous running, the temperature in the room soaring as high as 130\u00b0 in the tropical weather.\nEngineman 1st Class Roy P. Emerline from New London, Connecticut has his work\ncut out for him and his crew of Fireman Strikers. Strikers are junior enlisted nonpetty officers who want to learn one of the engineering rates such as Engineman,\nMachinist Mate, or Electrician\u2019s Mate. The men shut down the engines and begin\ntracing out all the usual suspects where dirt or water in the fuel may be affecting\nthe flow to the diesels. There are a number of inline particulate fuel oil filters that\nthe fuel passes through before it reaches the two gravity feed tanks located high\non the forward engine room bulkhead. Those filters, however, are for removing\ndirt and other particulates only. Centrifugal fuel purifiers designed to separate\nfuel from water had not yet been incorporated into the sub\u2019s equipment. The two\ngravity tanks not only feed fuel directly to the engines, but also serve as a fuel/water separation point, with the lighter fuel floating on the heavier water. At regular\nintervals the water must be drained off the bottom of the tank. If the crew is not\n35\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\ndiligent in this task, water can be ingested into the engines, a potentially disastrous situation.\nOn the 6th the cooks conduct an inspection of the food storage areas and discover that twelve pounds of fresh beef, six cans of condensed milk, twelve pounds\nof butter, 50 pounds of potatoes, and nine pounds of jam are unfit for human consumption. They report this to the boat\u2019s Commissary Officer, Gallemore, who approves the disposal of the rotten food. It is brought topside and tossed unceremoniously into the sea.\nOn 08 May at 8:10 a.m. the R-14 encounters a Matson Line passenger steamer\nheading southwest. They close the ship in an attempt to communicate, but semaphore signals are ignored and both ships continue on their way.\nOn the 8:00 p.m. to midnight watch on the 10th Gallemore makes the following\nentry in the log: \u201cLaying to as before southeast of Hawaii. Blew water from Fuel\nOil Tanks 4,5, & 6. Blew oil from #7 to #4&5 and flooded remaining after tanks.\u201d\nThis is a routine process of shifting fuel from the reserve tanks to the main fuel\ntanks as needed. Any hints that trouble was brewing are apparently missed during this time.\n\n36\n36\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nFigure 21.

A light breeze of two knots\nis doing a poor job of relieving the heat, soon to climb to 84\u00ba. Douglas and Gallemore once again alter the watch schedule, with Gallemore having the midnight to\n4:00 a.m., Douglas the 4:00 to 8:00 a.m., and Gallemore the 8:00 to noon. After a\nquick lunch, Douglas once again ascends the ladder up from the control room,\nthrough the conning tower, and up to the bridge. After the customary turnover of\nconditions, Douglas assumes the watch and Gallemore lays below to quell his\ngrowing hunger.\nThe search and the routine of the voyage continues this morning with no results. There is a growing anticipation of heading back to Pearl tomorrow, the initial satisfaction of being underway having been worn away by the routine and\nlack of results.\nAt 3:45 p.m. Gallemore again assumes the watch, anticipating another four\nboring hours of steaming around, poking holes in the Pacific Ocean. Just two hours\nlater, his mind fighting the numbness of the routine, Gallemore suddenly stands\nupright as he hears the engines begin to sputter and cough and suddenly quit. A\nhurried and somewhat resigned report is immediately received from the engine\nroom that they had to shut down the engines because of water in the fuel. Gallemore acknowledged the report and orders all stop. The boat drifts gently in the\nswells for only a short time. Just six minutes later they are underway again on\nboth engines, the problem apparently quickly resolved.\nJust twenty minutes later, at 6:10, the engine room calls up again and reports\nthat they had to shut down the starboard engine because they were \u201cunable to get\nsufficient fuel.\u201d Troubleshooting on the starboard side fuel system begins immediately as they continue on the port engine. At 7:22 the port engine sputters and\ndies \u201cbecause of no fuel\u201d and the boat comes to all stop, dead-in-the-water. At this\npoint there is most likely an assumption that water is once again in the fuel system, and Douglas comes up to the bridge to relieve Gallemore, sending his\n47\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nEngineering Officer below with instructions to investigate what is going on and\norders him to get it straightened out ASAP.\n\n48\n48\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\n11 MAY 1921, 9:15 P.M. \u201cHOIST WITH OUR\nOWN PETARD\u201d 9\nA haggard and sweaty Gallemore returns to the bridge a little over an hour\nlater, wiping his moist brow with a dirty rag. He gives Douglas a worried roll of\nhis eyes and then looks downward. Picking up on the cue, Douglas turns to the\nlookouts and says, \u201cLay below to the control room. I will call in a few minutes to\nhave you come back up.\u201d\nWith a quick \u201cAye, aye,\u201d both lookouts scuttle down the ladder. A few seconds\nlater, assured of privacy, Douglas speaks to Gallemore, trying desperately to tamp\ndown his growing concern. \u201cAll right, Roy. What the hell is going on?\u201d\n\u201cWell sir, we are just plain out of fuel. Chief Graham, along with Emerline and\nMcNamara, went and sounded all of the tanks using the sounding manifolds. I\nlooked over their shoulders and verified what they were seeing. Nothing but water. The reserve tanks #1 and #7 should have approximately 1000 gallons in them,\nbut they are full of comp water.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you blow fuel from #7 last night?\u2019\n\u201cWe thought we did. By our estimate we pretty well emptied #7 into 4 and 5,\nbut it looks now like we blew nothing but water.\u201d\n\u201cFor pity\u2019s sake, Roy! How did this happen?\u201d Douglas\u2019s voice rising as he fought\nto stay calm.\n\u201cDean\u2026\u201d Gallemore\u2019s head drops and he sighs heavily, \u201cI just don\u2019t know. The\nonly thing that makes sense is that the two reserve tanks, which we thought were\nalready full when we fueled, were in fact filled with only compensation water and\nempty of fuel.\u201d\n\n9\n\nThis entire section, \u201cHoist with our own petard\u201d was entirely of our own creation. No record remains of what transpired between Douglas and Gallemore during this tense period, but we believe that all of it can be safely inferred based on our research into the characters of these two\nmen and our first-hand knowledge of the culture of the Navy.\n49\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\n\u201cBut how\u2026\u201d, Douglas pauses, calming his thoughts and holding up his hand to\nstave off a reply from Gallemore, realizing that pursuing blame at this point is\nuseless. He takes several deep breaths before he looks back at his dejected Engineering Officer, the responsibility of what happened obviously weighing heavily\non the still young Floridian. \u201cWhat is the current status of the battery?\u201d\n\u201cCurrent specific gravity is 1.145 forward and 1.130 aft. Pretty much a full can,\nbut given our current position it isn\u2019t enough to get us all the way back, even if we\ngo to the nearest port, which is Hilo. Lighting and cooking alone will draw that\ndown further. We won\u2019t make it on the battery.\u201d\nDouglas mulls this for a moment, calculations whirring in his head. \u201cRight. If\nwe shut down everything except propulsion and keep the speed to three knots, we\nmight get 50 or 60 miles. We are about 140 miles from Hilo.\u201d He pauses while he\nconsiders other options. \u201cWell, we can call for help, but until we know for sure\nthat we are completely out of fuel I want to avoid putting our dirty laundry on the\nair.\u201d He pauses again, now resolved to action. \u201cGet back below and find us some\nfuel! Get whoever you need and do everything possible. Take the manhole covers\noff the tanks if necessary and dip it out with a spoon, but for pity\u2019s sake, find us\nsome damn fuel!\u201d\nGallemore sighs, crestfallen, but after a moment of reflection he stands up\nstraight, his discipline, training, and military bearing quickly returning. \u201cAye,\naye sir. I will see what can be done. If it\u2019s there we will find it.\u201d\nAs he turns to go down the hatch, Douglas stoops and puts his hand on Gallemore\u2019s shoulder, which causes the lieutenant to pause. \u201cLook Roy,\u201d Douglas says,\ntrying to soothe his friend\u2019s clearly wounded pride, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m a little irritated,\nbut we will figure this out. I know you will do your best.\u201d Gallemore looks up, a\nthankful expression on his face. \u201cOne more thing,\u201d says Douglas, \u201cwhen you get\nbelow, please find Chief Woodworth and send him up along with the lookouts.\u201d\nGallemore nods and heads down the ladder.\nLess than a minute later the two lookouts call up from the conning tower requesting permission to come to the bridge.\n\u201cGranted,\u201d said Douglas. The lookouts are accompanied by the Chief of the\nBoat. \u201cAh, Chief Woodworth. Thanks for coming up.\u201d Douglas quickly explains\nwhat is going on and passes on further instructions. \u201cGo below and pass the word.\nKill all the lights and anything electrical. Hand lanterns only. We need to preserve\n50\n50\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nthe battery. Have the cooks make sandwiches and cold coffee if anyone needs to\neat. Keep everyone out of the way of the engine room crew as they sound the\ntanks. Stomp on anyone who even looks like they are worried. Reassure them and\nstay positive. We are going to fix this somehow.\u201d\n\u201cNo problem sir. I\u2019ll make it happen. Permission to go below?\u201d Douglas nods\nand Woodworth bends his lanky frame and immediately heads below. Douglas\nonce again looks out at the dark sea, and chuckles quietly to himself at a line from\nShakespeare\u2019s Hamlet that commented on the irony of getting yourself into trouble.\n\u201cHoist by our own petard,\u201d Douglas mutters softly, smiling ruefully and shaking his head. 10\n\n. Let it work,\nFor \u2019tis the sport to have the enginer\nHoist with his own petard; and \u2019t shall go hard\nBut I will delve one yard below their mines\nAnd blow them at the moon.\n\u2014Shakespeare, Hamlet, Act III, Scene 4, line 230.\n10\n\nA \u201cpetard\u201d is a bomb, and \u201choist\u201d is \u201cto lift\u201d, so an \u201cenginer\u201d is an inventor, or engineer, who is\nblown up with his own device. Douglas\u2019s remark is quite apropros as a reflection on an engineering failure.\n\n51\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nNIGHT OF 11-12 MAY 1921, ADRIFT\nGallemore and the engineers work through the night, checking into every fuel\ntank by securing the compensation water system, venting the tanks, and removing the manhole inspection covers. All seven tanks are full, but only with oily water11. Chief Graham estimates that even if they somehow are able to draw off what\nlittle fuel they do find, they will have to let it settle for a few days to adequately\nseparate from the water, and even then they may get ten gallons if they are lucky.\nThat won\u2019t even get them a few minutes of steaming. Meanwhile, Douglas decides\nthat a message needs to be sent to SUBDIV 14 via the wireless describing their situation. Electrician\u2019s Mate 1st class (Radio) Raymond W. Waldron fires up the radio\ndown below in the control room, but reports that due to several hard to trace floating grounds in the set, he can\u2019t verify that the message went out, and regardless\nhe did not receive a reply.12\nBy 4:00 a.m. Douglas has been on watch on the bridge for eight hours and is\ntired. He know Gallemore is exhausted. He orders Gallemore to stand down and\nhit the rack for a nap, letting Chief Graham continue the search for oil. The two of\nthem will be making a lot of important decisions soon, and it will do no one any\ngood if they both pass out from exhaustion.\nGallemore assumes the watch at 7:45. Douglas goes below and has a sandwich,\nand tells Woodworth to gather the chiefs topside on the forward deck at 9:00.\nDouglas retreats to his bunk to take a quick nap and leaves word with the steward\nto wake him at 8:55, which is done promptly on schedule. The brief nap helped,\nbut Douglas is still bone tired. He heads topside and finds Woodworth and a heavily fatigued Graham standing on the port side of the big deck gun, with Chief Gunner\u2019s Mate Sidney Wilde and Chief Electrician\u2019s Mate Joe Hearne on the starboard\nside. He looks up at the bridge and Gallemore is there, within easy earshot. This is\nThe R-14\u2019s log books indicate that for a period of over 14 hours the boat was \u201clying to, trying to obtain fuel oil.\u201d The passages in this paragraph were inferred by the authors because of these log\nentries. Our experience indicates that every effort would have been made to find fuel.\n12\nR-14 log, page 295. Douglas indicated that they had been trying to send a radio message for four\ndays but without success. Although not directly indicated, this lack of success was most likely\ndue to some sort of electrical issue, a common problem on submarines of this vintage.\n52\n52\n11\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nreally the only place where he can get all of his senior staff together as long as\nGallemore is on the bridge.\nGraham updates them on the search for fuel, and as expected reported that\nthere is none. The six of them bat around ideas for a few minutes, none of which\nseem at all feasible. The embarrassing option of calling for a tow seems like the\nonly option, but they are in for a long wait, with food and water rationing becoming a necessity. The discussion continues, and while it can\u2019t be definitively shown\nwhose idea it was, at some point one of the six men ventures the idea of raising\nsails. Seemingly ludicrous at first, the idea gains momentum as the two Annapolis\ngraduates, both thoroughly trained in sailing techniques at the Academy, warm to\nthe idea.\nTheir enthusiasm for the outlandish idea grows. They know the boat will handle poorly, but the more they talk about it the more it seems to make sense. After\nten minutes Douglas is resolved. He puts Woodworth in charge of getting anyone\nhe needs and obtaining any materials he feels necessary. Realizing that it is darker\nthan Hades below it is decided that it is better to work topside, despite the narrow\ndeck. Satisfied that the issue is well in hand, Douglas lays below to get a follow-up\nmessage drafted and sent.13\n\n13\n\nThere is conflicting information on who actually had the idea of rigging sails. Several admittedly\nanecdotal sources on the internet give credit to Gallemore, yet they do not cite the source of this\nclaim. None other than Lieutenant Commander Robert G. Douglas, USN (Ret.) made the claim in\nan article he wrote (see citation below) that it was his father, Alexander Douglas, that came up\nwith the idea. Unable to confirm this either way, the authors have decided to make this salient\npoint somewhat vague. In the end, it was Douglas\u2019s decision to approve or disapprove the effort\nto rig sails, and it worked magnificently.\n53\n\n\fFigure 30.

Working their way\naround the periscope and mast tubes, Douglas waits outside the tiny radio shack\nwhile Waldron enters and sits down on a small stool. Douglas holds the light as\nWaldron grabs the handle of an open double-arm knife switch and lifts it up, pushing it hard into the upper connectors to close the power circuit. The set hums with\nelectricity from the batteries. Waldron begins to set up the transmitter to send the\nmessage, but just twenty seconds later there is a loud pop, a flash of blue light, and\na puff of smoke. Waldron flinches, but immediately reaches back to the power\nswitch and pulls it down. \u201cWell, crap,\u201d he says, waving his arms to disperse the\nsmoke. \u201cIt will take me a while to figure out what that was. Looks like we blew\nsomething in the transmitter. Sorry sir.\u201d14\nDouglas hangs his head and sighs loudly. Unable to believe their rotten luck\nand knowing that they are now on their own for sure, he watches for a few moments as Waldron begins to open up the transmitter. But he soon leaves, satisfied\nthat the situation is in good hands. He heads topside, leaving the lantern with Waldron to light up his work area. He is anxious to observe the first ever rigging of\nsails on a submarine.\nMost naval vessels gave up sails and the associated rigging over 20 years prior,\nbut Sailmaker\u2019s Mate was still an established enlisted rate,15 and Woodworth desperately wishes he has one of those specialists aboard as he gathers the needed\nequipment. Despite the lack of traditional materials, the R-14 still had some sailmaking tools onboard, as some of the crew use canvas hammocks and those\nneeded periodic maintenance. In addition, the boat occasionally rigs canvas awnings while in port in order to give the crew some level of shade from the tropic\n\nSubmarine Under Sail, page 3.QM1c H.D. Wilkinson, USN, date unknown. Wilkinson was an R-14\ncrewman who was aboard during the sailing incident. His article was apparently written many\nyears after the fact and contains numerous inaccuracies that don\u2019t concur with the known historical record. Somewhat apocryphal in nature, the story of the radio having a meltdown is in\nline with the difficulties that R-14 had in getting messages out, so we included it here.\n15\nUniform-Reference.net, https://uniform-reference.net/insignia/usn/usn_enl_ww1.html\n56\n56\n14\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nsun. Unfortunately, the awnings were left ashore and were not aboard this day.\nWoodworth has junior men dig into all the lockers below, looking for the right\nmaterials and tools, the process made more difficult by the lack of lights. Several\nmarlinespikes and awls are brought up topside, along with two heavy-duty sewing kits that have been used previously to repair hammocks. Two sailmaker\u2019s\npalms are found; these leather hand straps are used to protect the hands while\npushing the needles through the canvas. Several spools of leather lacing and two\nlarge rolls of marline (a two strand, left twisted, tarred jute line) are retrieved and\nbrought up.\nDown below Chief Wilde supervises the disassembly of metal bunk frames\nfrom the torpedo room, forward battery, and after battery. The canvas slings laced\nto the frames are sent up, along with the disassembled metal frame itself. Hammocks and the heavy wool blankets go up too.\nWhat to use for masts? The telescoping radio mast located just aft of the periscopes is the logical choice for the main sail, and fully raised, it was a considerable\nheight above the deck. But one sail would not be enough. Secured in storage brackets beneath the main deck inside the superstructure are two large poles. These are\nthe kingpost and boom used to form a crane for loading torpedoes. Men open up\ndeck hatches, unlatch the eight-foot long kingpost from its storage position and\nbring it forward.\nAt 9:30 a.m. the sewing of a foresail begins, the crew laying out twelve hammocks on the forward deck. The sail is two hammocks wide and six hammocks\nlong, sewed together using leather laces or marline, for a total of 150 square feet.\nThe hammocks are the preferred material, the thick canvas understood to be the\nstrongest material aboard.\nOnce completed, the sail is slung from a makeshift upper yardarm made from\nthe pipes of five bunk frames lashed end to end, with the ramrod for the 3-inch\ngun forming the lower yardarm. The kingpost is inserted into a socket, much like\na mast step, on the starboard side of the torpedo loading hatch, and the sail along\nwith the upper and lower yardarms are square-rigged to the kingpost. At approximately noon a breeze catches the makeshift sail and promptly fills it. With the\nsail set on a starboard tack a course is set to the west-northwest at 320\u00b0 true. R-14,\na diesel-direct drive submarine never intended to be propelled or maneuvered at\nsea by wind power, is now underway in a freshening breeze at an estimated one\n\n57\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nnautical mile per hour bound for Hilo Bay on the Big Island of Hawaii, 140 miles\ndistant.\n\nFigure 32.

By declutching both engines from the propeller shafts, the motion of\nthe boat through the water while under sail will cause the propellers to windmill\nin the water, slowly turning the shafts and the connected motor/generators. With\nthe switchboards and generators lined up for a battery charge, the rotating armatures in each generator provide enough current to maintain the batteries and\nmake up for any power loss to lighting and cooking, as long as that use is kept to a\nminimum. It is a master stroke of innovative thinking and Douglas immediately\napproves it. The charge is started at 12:30 p.m. and as far as can be determined\nfrom the logs, it continues until just before their arrival at Hilo.16 An exhausted\nDouglas, confident that Woodworth, Wilde and Gallemore have everything well\nin hand, lays below to his bunk and falls instantly to sleep.\nA major concern at this point is steering. The R-class submarines have an electric steering system, with a large motor back aft in the motor room, driving geared\nram shafts, pushing the rudder in one direction or the other. The steering motor\nis powered by the battery, and if energized and engaged will draw more power\nfrom the battery than can be spared, even with the trickle charge ongoing. For\nemergency purposes like this one, the boat\u2019s helm wheel in the control room can\nbe directly connected to the rudder by a geared, segmented shaft that leads all the\nway back to the rudder ram posts. By engaging the manual system, the helmsman\ndevelops all the power necessary to move the rudder using his arm strength alone.\nAlthough assisted somewhat by gearing, this effort is akin to a major upper body\nworkout in a gym, and thus requires the frequent, nearly hourly, relief of the\nhelmsman.\nHaving verified that the foresail is holding, the crew immediately sets to work\non a mainsail. This is to be made from the gray blankets. This sail is to be squarer\nat two blankets wide and three blankets long. The wool blankets are not quite as\ndurable as the canvas, so using the awls and marline the holes punched along the\n\n16\n\nThe authors were initially puzzled by the entry in the log on page 287 that indicated that a battery charge was conducted. Normally the engines have to be running in order to turn the generators for a battery charge, but the boat was out of fuel. Given the circumstances, this is the only\nway that a charge could have been conducted. The amount of current generated would have been\nlow and the practice somewhat dangerous due to the generation of hydrogen in the battery and\nthe inability to vent it. Many thanks go to Jim Christley for confirming our hypothesis.\n59\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nsides of each blanket are reinforced with stitching. Once again, the yardarm is\nrigged from lashed-together bunk frames, but this time the lower yardarm is built\nusing the one-inch diameter curtain rods from the officer\u2019s bunk area. At 6:45 that\nevening, the new mainsail is hoisted to the fully extended radio mast. Estimated\nspeed rises to 1.5 knots, still on a starboard tack bound for Hilo. Douglas relieves\nGallemore at 3:45 p.m. on the bridge, and orders Woodworth and the ersatz sailmakers below for a rest, the oncoming twilight making it too risky to continue\nwork topside. It is necessary to have a small contingent of the crew topside at all\ntimes to tend the sheets, and this watch is promptly set. What is on Douglas\u2019ss\nmind at this point is not recorded, but it can be safely surmised that he feels a great\ndeal of pride and satisfaction at his crew\u2019s magnificent can-do attitude.\nThe 13th dawns as all the others have with beautiful sailing weather pushing\nthem along quite nicely, if not a bit slowly. A wave of excitement ripples through\nthe boat when Cape Kumukahi, the Big Island\u2019s eastern most point, is sighted at\n10:00 a.m., three points on the port bow. This visible indicator of their progress is\nvindication of their efforts, furthering their resolve. At 10:05 the sailmakers once\nagain set to work, starting on a third sail. This is to be made from eight blankets,\ntwo wide and four long. With a yardarm made from more bunk frames, the new\nsail is to be hoisted on a makeshift mizzenmast made using the torpedo-loading\nboom, stepped on the aft deck in a socket to starboard of the engine room hatch.\nBy 2:30 p.m. the mizzen sail is complete and it is hoisted to the wind. Speed increases to an estimated two knots, measured by tying a closed can to the end of a\nline, throwing the can in the water at the bow, and timing its drift aft.17 A course\nchange to 335\u00b0 true is made.\nWith the electric ventilation fans shut down it is stuffy, sweltering, and oppressively humid below. Douglas allows the crew to come topside to escape the\nmuggy conditions during the day, but safety considerations dictate that only the\nwatch standers can be topside at night. The boat is quite a sight, with shoeless,\n\nR-14 Under Way, Under Sail, Lieutenant Commander Robert G. Douglas, USN (Ret.), Naval History\nMagazine, August, 2004, page 61. The author of this article is the son of Alexander Douglas. Additional information on how the sails were made and rigged came not only from the logs, but from\na clipping from a Navy publication (the title is not indicated on the clipping), written by Journalist Chief Petty Officer E.J. Jeffrey, USN in the early 1950\u2019s, and forwarded to the authors by Bruce\nGallemore, grandson of Roy Trent Gallemore. The clipping has a handwritten note at the bottom\nby Gallemore to his grandson.\n60\n60\n\n17\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nhatless, and shirtless crewmen lounging on deck anyplace there is space. Boredom\nis prevalent, so they play cards, read books, and munch on the remaining unspoiled fruit in the open air, with morale remaining high despite the tenuous nature of the makeshift voyage.\nFor the next twenty hours, a course of 335\u00b0 true is steered until 8:00 a.m. on 14\nMay, when course is altered to 330\u00b0 true. At 9:00 a.m. the course is altered to 310\u00b0\nto fight a frustrating one knot current they sail into off Cape Kumukahi. Various\nnorthwesterly courses are steered through the night of 14 May, trying to beat an\nopposing current, and trying to keep the sails before the wind.\nA half hour after the watch change at midnight, with Douglas on the bridge,\nthere is a sudden shift in the direction of the trade winds from due east to due west\nwithin a few seconds. Anyone who has sailed a boat understands the work a shift\nlike this causes. There was a mad scramble on the decks to move the makeshift\nsails from the long-standing starboard tack over to a port tack, all in the pitch\ndark. The job takes a half hour to accomplish. A new course of true north is set and\nsteered as the sub sails in the dark through fog and intermittent rain squalls\nthroughout the midwatch, the first less than perfect weather they encounter.\nStill steering due north and on a port tack, the R-14 sails on until 05:00 a.m.,\nwhen the course is shifted left to steer 300\u00b0. At 5:33 on the morning of the 15th,\nDouglas orders ahead on the starboard shaft and holds this for four minutes, then\nstops it. This is done to maintain the desired course against the current and a\nstacking of winds. Douglas feels it is worth the risk of depleting the battery due to\ntheir proximity to Hilo, just twenty-five miles distant.\nSince the night of 11-12 May, Douglas has not been able to ascertain if any of the\nradio messages he had been trying to send have been successful. Waldron is eventually able to jury-rig the transmitter, but they never receive replies and indeed\nWaldron cannot verify that anything is going out (it is not).Radio was still a hitor-miss art, and the lack of air conditioning on the R-class and other submarines\nmakes for damp conditions aboard; shorts and grounds in the electrical system are\na common occurrence.\nAt 5:40 a.m. Waldron at last succeeds in getting a message through to the SUBDIV 14 Duty Officer informing him of R-14\u2019s status, her previous 8:00 p.m. position\n(the last good navigational fix they have), and their intention to sail to Hilo.18 The\n18\n\nR-14 log, page 295.\n61\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nmessage is immediately given to Nimitz, who is now back in port. R-14\u2019s sister boat\nand division mate R-12 (SS-89) had completed her repairs on the 6th and has been\nrunning local training operations since. Nimitz immediately gets word to her\nCommanding Officer to make immediate preparations to get underway to render\nassistance. R-12, moored outboard of the tender Rainbow (AS-7), immediately\nmoves over to Pier 2 near Chicago and takes aboard twenty days provisions and\nadditional fresh water. They have a verified 9944 gallons of fuel onboard, more\nthan enough to get them to Hilo, transfer some to R-14, and return. At 8:45 a.m.\nthey cast off and head out of the harbor, bound for the Big Island.19\n\nLog Book, USS R-12, Jan. 1,1921 to Dec. 31, 1921, page 289.\n62\n62\n\n19\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nFigure 33.

Jim Christley\u2019s illustration of the sailing rig. All three sails were squared rigged to\ntheir makeshift masts, and are shown here set on a starboard tack, the configuration they\nwere in for most of the voyage under sail. The torpedo loading kingpost and boom that were\nused for the fore and mizzen masts were only eight feet tall, thus those sail\u2019s proximity to the\ndeck. All three masts had a pulley block shackled to the top, through which the line used to\nhoist the bunk-frame yardarms was run. Sheet lines were attached to the lower corners of\neach sail and were tied off to cleats on deck at an angle to hold the sails and yardarms on the\nstarboard tack. In the early morning hours of 14 May there was a mad scramble on deck to\nreposition the sheets and sails to a port tack, caused by a shift in the trade winds. This was a\ndangerous evolution on a narrow deck in the dark. It is indeed remarkable that such little sail\narea was able to move the boat at all, and it is a testament to the steadiness of the trade winds\nnear Hawaii.\n64\n64\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\n15-17 MAY 1921, ARRIVAL AT HILO AND\nRETURN TO PEARL HARBOR\nAt 6:00 a.m. Hilo is in sight on the port side. Douglas now deems them close\nenough to Hilo that the sails are no longer needed. He orders Chief Woodworth\nand his sailmakers topside and they immediately set to work de-rigging all that\nthey had done. The makeshift sails are taken below along with the bunk frames\nand everything properly stowed or reassembled. The torpedo loading kingpost\nand boom that have served so adequately as makeshift masts are also taken down\nand restowed in their brackets below the main deck. As they are working, Douglas\norders ahead slow on both shafts, providing a speed of three knots. Chief Hearne\nand his electricians immediately begin monitoring the specific gravities in both\nbattery wells, taking readings each half hour, ensuring the discharge rate is sustainable. The course is 310\u00ba true during the approach to the long thin Hilo breakwater.\nCourse is changed to 290\u00ba and speed increased to four knots for the final approach to the harbor entrance. Gallemore relieves Douglas on the bridge and the\nmaneuvering watch is stationed. At 8:20 a.m. they triumphantly sail under battery power around the end of the breakwater and into Hilo Bay. At 9:45 a.m. they\ncome alongside the commercial Matson Line pier, throw over and double the\nmooring lines, and secure the maneuvering watch. Exhausted, haggard looking,\nand tired of bully beef and rice, the first action of the crew is to walk to the end of\nthe pier and have a delicious meal and a beer at a Chinese restaurant.20 Satiated,\nthey revel in the glory of having achieved the improbable feat of raising sail on a\nsubmarine and turning a near disaster into a triumph of ingenuity and innovative\nthinking.\nFor the next twenty-two hours the boat is conspicuously quiet; just routine entries are made in the log. The exhausted crew take the time to catch up on a lot of\nmissed sleep, having reassembled their bunks and re-slung their hammocks.\nFresh water restrictions are loosened, allowing the crew to clean up and shave,\nand to wash dirty uniforms. The boat\u2019s arrival under these circumstances generates a lot of interest, and a reporter sends out a wire story which is picked up by\n20\n\nWilkinson, page 9. Once again, the story of going to the Chinese restaurant at the end of the Matson pier is an entertaining but somewhat unreliable tale, but we included it here for a bit of\ncolor.\n65\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nnewspapers as far away as Duluth, Minnesota, and Manchester, New Hampshire.\nThe crew are minor celebrities in this laid-back tropical town.\nAt 7:30 a.m. on the 16th the R-12 steams into the harbor and ties up on the other\nside of the pier from R-14. R-12\u2019s arrival is a welcome event, and the crews of both\nboats immediately turn-to, transferring provisions and bringing over fuel hoses\nto transfer fuel. As soon as there is enough fuel onboard, R-14 begins a battery\ncharge with both engines, and this proceeds even with the fueling in progress. The\nelectricians replenish depleted battery water, and by 10:45 a.m. the battery charge\nis complete. A total of 1762 gallons of fuel has been transferred.\nR-12 casts off at 10:55 and heads out of the harbor, followed by R-14 at 11:15. The\nboats proceed in formation along Hawaii\u2019s northern shore before cutting east into\nthe Alalakeiki Channel between Maui and Kahoolawe. They steam into the Kalohi\nChannel between Molokai and Lanai before turning west-northwest toward\nOahu. They are anxious to get back and their speed varies between nine and\neleven knots.\nAt 6:50 a.m. on the 17th they are at the approaches for Pearl Harbor. They proceed smartly up the channel, and pause briefly to allow the USS Celtic (AF-2) to\npass on her way out to sea. They maneuver into Southeast Loch and at 7:26 tie up\nto Pier 1 at the Submarine Base.\n\ud83c\udf2c\n\nDouglas and his crew have performed magnificently in triumphing over adversity. They never gave up despite facing multiple problems, and their actions\nshowed grit and determination. However, Douglas\u2019ss tremendous satisfaction\nwith his crew and his relief with being back at Pearl Harbor is tempered by the\nfact that he now has to report to Nimitz and explain how this all occurred in the\nfirst place. Douglas is determined, and will truthfully answer any awkward questions that Nimitz may have.\n\n66\n66\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nFigure 36.

There are only routine in-port entries in her log. Some new crew members were received, and two of the crew,\nWilde and Emerline, left the boat, with Emerline being discharged from the Navy.\nOn the 24th, she got underway for torpedo practice,21 successfully firing two BlissLeavitt Mk 7 weapons before quickly returning to base. On the 25th they repeated\nthe exercise, although this time the single weapon fired ran cold, failing to start\nupon launch.\n26 May 1921 was a significant day. Douglas got the boat underway and headed\ndown channel to the fuel pier and took onboard 9744 gallons of fuel. With only 262\ngallons of fuel remaining from the amount transferred to them by the R-12 at Hilo,\nthe boat now had slightly over 10,000 gallons onboard. It can be safely surmised\nthat an extra amount of attention was paid to this process, given their earlier experience. At 12:46 they got underway and returned to the sub base, mooring at\nPier #1. At 3:00 p.m., quarters for the crew were held for a change of command\nceremony. Lieutenant Clarke was officially relieved of command of the R-14 by\nLieutenant Clifford H. Roper, who had been cross-decked over from command of\nthe R-13. As had been previously stated, Clarke had already been unofficially\nworking for several months on Nimitz\u2019s staff, and the official orders now formalized the arrangement. The assignment of Roper to command the R-14 would have\nbeen considered a lateral career move, neither a higher nor lesser command, and\nthe authors believe this to be a significant part of the tale as a whole, which will\nbe explained later. Douglas and Gallemore stayed aboard the boat and simply reverted to their previous duties as Executive Officer and Engineering Officer.\n21\n\nThe logs mention the boat going to the \u201ctorpedo range\u201d but do not specify where that range was.\nThe boat was underway for only 30 minutes before arriving at the range, where she came to all\nstop, trimmed down, and fired two torpedoes. When completed she was underway for only 12\nminutes before tying up to Pier #1 at the sub base. This indicates that the torpedo range was\nwithin the harbor itself, possibly in East Loch or Middle Loch.\n73\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nRoper wasted no time in getting to know his new boat and got his new command\nunderway for torpedo firing practice three of the next six days.\nThe month of May was closed out by Lieutenant Gallemore with the simple entry, \u201cBoat secure, Inspected by the duty officer.\u201d\n\n74\n74\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nFigure 39.

From a reproduction of the original log, supplied by the National Archives.\n\n79\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nHOW AND WHY\nRunning out of fuel at sea is an extremely rare occurrence in the Navy. In fact,\nneither author is aware of any other circumstances in which this has actually happened to a major warship, although given the nearly 175-year history of operating\npowered vessels in the Navy, it is at least possible. Multiple personnel onboard\nship look at and keep track of fuel quantity and usage, from the senior Petty Officers and Chiefs in the Engineering Department, through the Engineering Officer,\nand all the way to the Commanding Officer. For all these men to miss what should\nhave been obvious would be rare indeed. The crew of the R-14 were clearly surprised at the fact that they ran out of fuel, as the logs indicate that they spent 14\nhours searching the tanks for any useful amount. In addition, wire service reporters that interviewed the crew upon arrival in Hilo reported that the crew could\nnot account for how they ran dry.22 If the crew was surprised by running out of\nfuel, then the only way to explain it was that either there was a previously unknown leak in one or more of the tanks, or that they believed they had more fuel\nonboard then they actually had when they went to the fuel pier in Pearl Harbor.\nThe Electric Boat design R-class submarines had a normal and reserve fuel capacity of 10,383 gallons. This fuel was contained in seven tanks, three flat-topped\ntanks located underneath the torpedo room, the tops of which formed the walking\ndeck, and four similar tanks underneath the engine room. Tanks 1 and 7 were designated as reserve tanks, with tanks 2,3,4,5, and 6 as the ready service tanks.23\nThere was also a capacity of 8,880 gallons that could be carried in addition to the\nnormal and reserve amounts, but this amount had to be carried in the ballast\ntanks, rendering the boat incapable of submerging until it was used up and the\ntanks cleared; the concept of the fuel ballast tank had not yet been implemented\nin the USN. This \u201cemergency\u201d capacity was intended for very long surface transits, like crossing the Atlantic, and was not routinely used by any R-boat. It definitely was not part of the R-14\u2019s fuel loadout for this voyage.\n\nFrom two identical articles, one in the Duluth Evening Herald, May 17, 1921 and another in the\nManchester Democrat, July 13, 1921.\n23\nThese diagrams were supplied to the authors from naval historian and author Jim Christley, who\nobtained them from a former crewmember.\n80\n80\n22\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nThe R-14\u2019s logs provide an initially confusing picture of the fuel issue. On 01\nMay the logs indicate that she had 4,270 gallons of fuel on board. As indicated in\nPart One, after receiving the orders to get underway and search for the Conestoga,\nthe R-14 went to the fuel pier and took on 3,318 gallons, for a total prior to getting\nunderway of 7,588 gallons. On the first day of steaming while headed for the operation area they burned 385 gallons, so at the end of the day on 02 May, they had\n7,203 gallons remaining.\nThe authors went through each day\u2019s logs and computed the average underway\nfuel usage as being 840 gallons per day. This average figure would have been a\nwell-known data point onboard. The R-14 had been in commission for over 18\nmonths and Clarke had been her only CO during this time. He would have been\nvery familiar with how much fuel the boat burned during an average day\u2019s steaming. The long voyage from California to Hawaii in 1920 provided the numerous\ndata points needed to compute this figure. This knowledge would have naturally\nbeen passed on to Douglas and Gallemore. In addition, the technically savvy chiefs\nand senior petty officers in the Engineering Department would have been very\naware of this figure as well.\nSo, with 7,588 gallons on board when they got underway, and with an average\nusage of 840 gallons a day, it should have been blindingly apparent to anyone that\nthe boat was headed to sea without enough fuel onboard to complete a 10-day mission.\nThe capacity of reserve tanks 1 and 7 are a total of 2,708 gallons. If added to the\n4,270 gallons that was recorded to be onboard on 01 May that comes to 6,978 gallons. This is the amount of fuel that Douglas must have believed he had once they\narrived at the fuel pier. This dictates the 3,318 gallons that was taken onboard at\nthat time. Douglas and his crew thought they were getting underway with 10,296\ngallons, enough for a 10-day mission with an approximate 19% reserve. It is apparent now that both of the reserve tanks were empty of fuel and full only of compensation water, when the crew, including Douglas, thought otherwise. This\nwould explain their puzzlement at finding themselves at sea and out of fuel.\nHow was this extremely important data point missed? So much time has\npassed, and so much contemporary material has been lost that we cannot arrive\nat the root cause. Former NASA Space Shuttle Program Manager and Flight Director Wayne Hale once said that any accident investigation has to ask \u201cwhy\u201d at least\n\n81\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nseven times before arriving at the root cause.24 We will not be able to adhere to\nthat principal in this case due to the amount of time that has passed, but the principal is sound and we will apply it here to the greatest extent possible. In the case\nof gaps in verifiable information, the authors will use their collective experience\nto conduct informed and conservative speculation as to causes.\n\nLOGS\nIn 1921 the US Navy actually kept two logs of the minute-to-minute details of\noperations aboard ship. Each day the duty Quartermaster hand wrote the deck log\nand the senior watch member in the Engineering Department kept the engineering logs. At the end of each month these logs were gathered together, combined,\nreviewed, and typed up on Navy Form 325. If the ship was large enough to have\nan administrative department, it was handled at that level. If not, the squadron or\ndivision would handle the typing. The authors have in their possession copies of\nthe typed logs that were formally submitted to the Department of the Navy for\nrecord-keeping purposes. Apparently, the hand-written logs were disposed of\nonce the typewritten logs were signed and submitted since they were not filed at\nthe National Archives.\nThe first thing that stands out is the incredible lack of attention to detail in the\nlogs. There are numerous misspellings, typing overstrikes, and outright errors.\nFor instance, on the day the R-14 arrived in Hilo, at the top of the log page where it\nshould have been labeled as \u201cLog of the United States Ship R-14\u201d the typist put\ndown R-12. For the 4th and 5th of May the lube oil and fuel oil usage are exactly the\nsame, with the same totals, which is clearly not possible. Gallemore and Douglas\nsigned the logs at the end of each watch, and both Clarke and Douglas signed the\nlog at the bottom of each page as the Commanding Officer and Navigator (even\nthough Clarke was not aboard for the voyage). When an officer affixes his signature to a log, he is affirming that the log is accurate and true. Yet the logs clearly\nwere not. This sloppiness in the typed logs indicate that there was not the proper\nemphasis on this important task from the senior command level (i.e., SUBDIV 14),\nnor the proper oversight from those responsible for submitting proper and accurate logs (Douglas and Clarke). It is entirely possible that this lackadaisical\n\nPilot Error is Never Root Cause, Wayne Hale, 2015, https://waynehale.wordpress.com/2015/07/29/pilot-error-is-never-root-cause/\n82\n82\n\n24\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nstandard in regard to log keeping would also be found in the day-to-day handwritten logs. If so, then it is reasonable to speculate that an error in recording fuel\nusage or recording a fuel offload due to a maintenance period was the cause.\nClearly, the crew believed they had 6,978 gallons on board when they arrived at\nthe fuel pier, but they did not, and this is most likely to due to poor record-keeping.\nStrangely, the typed logs seem to indicate the actual amount of fuel on board,\nnot the perceived amount. For instance, on 08 May, five days before they were due\nto arrive back in Pearl Harbor, the typed log indicates that during the day they\nused 900 gallons of fuel and had 2,108 gallons remaining. With five days to go, it\nshould have been very apparent that they weren\u2019t going to make it. The fact that\nthe typed logs were corrected after the fact to show the actual amounts we believe\nwas directed by Nimitz. He wanted the official log submitted to the Dept. of the\nNavy to be accurate in this regard.\nWhy the logs were in a sloppy state is hard to say. It could be due to a lack of\nadministrative personnel and skilled typists in Hawaii at the time. Indeed, we already know that Nimitz operated with gapped billets on his staff, and even the\nR-14 herself did not have an enlisted yeoman assigned. More alarmingly it may\nhave come from a general lack of standards within the squadron or within the entire Naval District itself. This does not sound like a situation that the normally\nmeticulous Nimitz would have tolerated, but he had only been in Hawaii for less\nthan a year at that point, and much of his time and effort had been spent willing\nthe submarine base into existence. He may not yet have had the time at that period\nto concentrate on operational and administrative issues for the squadron.\n\nPROCEDURAL COMPLIANCE\nOn a submarine in those days there wasn\u2019t a traditional \u201cgas gauge\u201d that you\nsimply looked at to determine how much fuel you had. For each fuel tank there\nwas a sounding manifold, a collection of 3/8\u201d copper tubes that ran to different\nlevels of the tank. Each tube had a petcock style valve at the end. Starting at the\ntube for the lowest level of the tank, the assigned sailor would open the petcock\nand allow the outflow to drain into a bucket. After a set time to ensure clearing of\nthe line of any residual amount left from the previous sounding, the sailor would\nobserve the flow to determine whether it was water or fuel. If they got fuel from\n83\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nthe tube representing the lowest part of the tank, they would immediately know\nthat the tank was completely full and would close the petcock. If they got water,\nthey would move to the next highest tube and repeat the procedure. Using the\nconcept that fuel floats on water, they would continue this process until they got\nfuel or until the last tube petcock had been cycled. Which line, if any, they got fuel\nfrom told them how much fuel was in the tank.\nIn Part One we speculated on a scenario in which prior to heading to the fuel\npier a hurried Chief Graham and Lieutenant Gallemore blindly trusted the information that was in the existing hand-written logs and no attempt was made to\nsound the tanks to empirically determine their levels. This error in judgment\nwould have most likely been prompted by the rushed and hurried nature of the\npre-underway preparations. The imperative to get going immediately took precedence over good engineering practice, skewing their judgment. If true, this\nwould have been a very fateful and consequential decision indeed.\nIt is also completely plausible that the tanks were actually sounded, but due to\nthe fact that more experienced personnel were working other items on the checklists, junior, inexperienced crewmen were tasked with this procedure. Not yet\nfully trained or fully qualified, they may have misinterpreted what they saw when\nlooking into their bucket, thinking they saw fuel oil but in fact it was only oily\nwater. They may also not have let the flow run long enough when they initially\nopened the petcock and may have seen oil left in the sounding line from the previous evolution. More experienced crewmen most likely would not have made\nthese simple errors and would have been more diligent at the task.\nAt any rate, it is likely that there was a serious lapse in procedural compliance.\nDetermining the absolute level of a fuel tank prior to taking on fuel is a timeproven and experience-honed procedure in the USN, with its origins going as far\nback as the coal burning days. Indeed, this procedure is a basic necessity in order to\ntake on the proper and needed amount and to avoid potentially hazardous spills\ndue to overfilling the tank. It has been accepted procedure since 12 October 1900,\nthe day that the USN\u2019s first submarine, the USS Holland, was commissioned, but\nit clearly was not accomplished this day. Why this established and tested procedure was not followed on 02 May 1921 will be discussed below.\n\n84\n84\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nBLOWING THE TANKS\nThe authors considered the idea that the fuel tank blowing procedure that was\nconducted at 1:00 pm on 02 May, prior to going to the fuel pier, may have resulted\nin the crew going too far. In their hurry to get the underway preparations completed, they may have been overzealous in the procedure, resulting in not only the\ncompensation water being blown overboard, but the fuel as well, specifically the\nfuel in reserve tanks #1 and 7. It is easy to see how this may have been done, because knowing when to stop by observing the oil sheen on the water topside is\nadmittedly an exercise in judgment. However, in considering this scenario, the\nauthors concluded that while possible, it was unlikely. Reserve tanks #1 and 7 held\n2,708 gallons, and if the crew had blown these two tanks dry the sheen created\ntopside would have been immense, giving the crew a very obvious reason to empirically determine the tank levels. The \u201coops factor\u201d of the huge sheen alone\nwould have prompted this.\n\nFUEL TANK LEAK\nThe idea that there may have been a leak in one or more of the fuel tanks was\ninitially considered by the authors. All submarines built by the USN up to this time\nhad been of all-riveted construction. The frame rings were riveted to the keel and\nthe hull and tank plating were riveted to the frames. Welding was a new and not\nyet trusted science and this revolutionary construction method would not be incorporated into submarine construction for several more years. Riveted seams\ncan, and often did, work loose due to the motion of the boat in a seaway and they\nrequired constant caulking in order to remain watertight.25 Leakage was a fairly\ncommon occurrence. In 1941 the partially riveted fleet submarine Narwhal (SS167) lost 20,000 gallons of fuel to leakage in one 30-day training cruise.26\nHowever, once the fuel quantity data from the logs was considered, the authors\nrejected the idea that a fuel leak was solely responsible for the boat running out of\nfuel. The reason for our decision was the fuel quantity numbers in the logs. As\nNo More Heads or Tails: The Adoption of Welding in U.S. Navy Submarines, David L. Johnston, The\nSubmarine Review, June, 2020, page 46-48.\n26\nU.S. Subs in Action, Robert C. Stern, 1979, page 20.\n25\n\n85\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\npointed out above, the crew clearly believed that they had 6,978 gallons of fuel\nonboard when they arrived at the fuel pier. In the course of the post-incident investigation, Nimitz without a doubt would have asked the question, \u201cDid you\nsound the tanks prior to taking on fuel?\u201d If they answered in the affirmative and\ncould show that proper procedure had been followed, then the initial amount of\nfuel recorded in the official typed log on 02 May would have been the previously\nmentioned 6,978 gallons, not the 4,270 gallons that was actually recorded.\nIt is very important to understand that the only way that a fuel leak could have\nbeen the root cause of the incident would have been if the initial amount of fuel\nonboard had actually been 6,978 gallons, and when combined with the 3,318 gallons that they took onboard at the fuel pier, the total amount of fuel onboard when\nthey left the fuel pier and headed to sea was 10,296 gallons. Only under these conditions is it reasonable to speculate that during the course of the period at sea a hole\nor a gapped seam in one or more tanks led to the fuel leaking out and caused the\nboat to run dry, given the fact that the boat ran out of fuel on the 10th day.\nIf the boat got underway with the 7,588 gallons indicated in the log (4,270 initial and 3,318 taken on at the fuel pier), and had a fuel leak, then the boat would\nhave run dry at some time on the 6th day, not the 10th.\nSubsequent research has shown that indeed there was a leak in one of the fuel\ntanks. Bruce Gallemore, Lieutenant Gallemore\u2019s grandson, provided the authors\nwith a copy of a page from Lieutenant Gallemore\u2019s personal diary. This particular\npage was a hand-written recap of the events of 02-17 May 1921, and the events described therein were closely in line with the official logs. However, in the lower\nright-hand corner, Gallemore made a small note that read, \u201cLater: Leak in tank\nfound at overhaul.\u201d Location, size, and particulars of the leak were not given. In\naddition, during an interview with another of Gallemore\u2019s grandsons, Roy A.\nSmith, Smith revealed to the authors that he had conducted a taped interview of\nhis grandfather in 1977 just prior to his death. During that interview Gallemore\nmentioned again that a leak had been found in a subsequent overhaul.\nGiven this information, it is safe to say that indeed the R-14 suffered from some\nlevel of fuel leakage during the May 1921 incident. While a leak may have been a\ncontributing factor, given all the information above, we believe that it was not the\nroot cause. Why? Because the fuel amount recorded in the log had to come from\nsomewhere. If Nimitz had asked, \u201cDid you sound the fuel tanks prior to taking on\nfuel\u201d, and Douglas and Gallemore had answered with a sheepish and embarrassed\n86\n86\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\n\u201cNo\u201d, then once again simple math would have shown that the reserve tanks that\nthey thought were full were actually empty and this would have dictated the 4,270\ngallons that was recorded in the typed log. With Clarke, Douglas, and Gallemore\nsigning the logs verifying that they are true and accurate, and given that this was\na prime data point of the investigation, we believe that these numbers can be\ntrusted when other parts of the logs cannot.\n\nLEADERSHIP, OVERSIGHT, AND ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES\nIt has been policy within the USN since 13 October 1775 that the Commanding\nOfficer of a vessel is ultimately responsible for everything that goes on aboard his\nship. This is an essential tenet that establishes clear command authority and an\nunquestioned line of responsibility. Part of his duties is exercising the proper level\nof oversight so that he is informed as to the status of his command, but without\nmicromanaging behavior that can stifle initiative and creative problem solving. It\nis a fine line to walk, and failing to do so in a competent manner can adversely\naffect command effectiveness.\nAs noted, there were numerous instances in which a lack of leadership and\noversight occurred during the month of May, 1921, aboard the R-14, specifically\nrelated to running out of fuel. The senior petty officers did not properly supervise\nthe junior personnel, the chief petty officers did not fully inculcate professionalism and the need to follow regulations and procedures, and Douglas and Gallemore did not instill and emphasize the proper command climate, a climate that\npromotes attention to detail and procedural compliance. Given the fact that determining absolute fuel levels is a basic necessity of effectively operating a warship,\nand given the fact that the boat ran out of fuel and the crew was surprised by this,\nit is apparent that everyone in a position of leadership aboard R-14 fell short of\nproperly negotiating that fine line of leadership and oversight.\nAt this point we must return to Wayne Hale\u2019s previously cited thesis Pilot Error\nIs Never Root Cause (sic). Hale makes the profound point that simply blaming an\naircraft accident on pilot error is a vast oversimplification that can obscure the\nreal root cause, and in doing so may lead to the same incident happening again.\nPointing the finger at Douglas, and by proxy Gallemore, is perhaps only the first\n\u201cwhy\u201d of several more whys of this story. Those whys are mitigating factors, and\nonce examined, will provide a more rounded picture and greatly aid in\n87\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nunderstanding the root cause, or causes. These factors are listed below in no particular order of importance:\n1. Paradise (a.k.a. \u201cTahiti\u201d) Syndrome. People from Anglo/European/American cultures in this post-Edwardian period were known for\ntheir social conservativism, Judeo/Christian values, and highly disciplined ways. When exposed to the sub-tropical, idyllic \u201cparadise\u201d of beautiful Hawaii with its peaceful and uncomplicated environment and comparatively permissive morality, people of highly driven, goal-oriented,\npressure-cooker cultures can develop a type of mental malaise. This condition expresses itself in a loss of interest in normal activities, a decline in\ndiscipline, a heightened desire to \u201cdrop-out\u201d and relax, and oftentimes an\nincreased potential for substance abuse. It is a particular problem within\nmilitary services, and if not properly managed by the command leadership, it can lead to the very problems in attention to detail and procedural\ncompliance noted above. Both authors have personal experience with this\npotentially debilitating malady while serving in places like Hawaii, the\nPhilippines, and other tropical locales and have seen first-hand the impacts it can have on crew effectiveness. The Hawaiian Islands in 1921 were\nstill a largely primitive and undeveloped paradise, and they had a Jimmy\nBuffett/Paul Gauguin-like lure to the young men who were stationed\nthere. This was undoubtedly a factor that complicated the leadership issues faced by the officers and Chiefs of the R-14, and indeed by every military command in Hawaii. This \u201cparadise syndrome\u201d was a prime factor\nin the incident aboard HMS Bounty in 1789, and it played a role in the\nevents of 07 December 1941.\n2. The Nature of Naval Operations in Hawaii in 1921. Two and a half years\nafter the end of World War I, operations for the entire United States Navy,\nand in particular the units stationed in Hawaii, had devolved to a stable,\nlow-intensity and low-key peacetime standard. It was widely believed\nthat WWI had been the \u201cwar to end all wars\u201d and that energetic military\ntraining was no longer necessary. Budgetary cutbacks and the onset of\npost-war disarmament treaties had furthered that lassitude. While it was\nunderstood that our forces needed to remain ready, the War Department\nhad trouble defining what they needed to be ready for. Routine had become paramount, with a natural and somewhat understandable\n88\n88\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nreluctance to break it.27 The majority of the operations undertaken by the\nSUBDIV 14 boats during this period consisted of short, one or two-day\ntraining operations in the immediate vicinity of Oahu. Given this situation, it is not hard to see how an unanticipated, last-minute order to get\nunderway for a 10-day, blue water contingency search and rescue operation could have thrown the routine of the R-14 askew, leading to rushed\ndecisions and lapses in judgment and procedure.\n3. Organization Aboard R-class Submarines. The R-class submarines\nwere billeted for three officers and twenty-seven enlisted.28 However,\nthis obscures the fact that the officers would have been \u201cmulti-hatted\u201d\nduring their tour aboard, filling multiple collateral duties as required by\nNaval Regulations. These positions included Commanding Officer, Executive Officer, Navigator, Communications Officer, Engineering Officer,\nGunnery Officer, Commissary Officer, and First Lieutenant.29 The Commanding Officer by himself has a long list of duties and responsibilities\nand was typically not assigned any other collateral duties. This left all of\nthe other tasks to be performed by only two officers. This required them\nto multi-task at a very high level, a situation that is difficult to manage\neven by early 21st century standards, where highly educated officers have\na myriad of automatic systems to assist them, and outright problematic in\n1921. A fourth officer billet would have been immensely helpful in easing\nthe workload. It is also known that while in port at Pearl Harbor, officers\nfrom the division\u2019s boats were called to the flagship Chicago to stand\nwatches there as Officer of the Deck. For instance, Gallemore stood two\nofficer-of the deck (OOD) watches on the Chicago on 26 May, after the\nR-14\u2019s return to port.30 These extra watches pulled the officers of the boats\naway from their already assigned duties and made the problems of overwork caused by inadequate billeting even more acute. In addition, the\nboat was not billeted for an enlisted yeoman, a sailor specializing in typing and administrative tasks. The presence of a yeoman would have eased\nthe administrative burden on the officers and may have prevented some\nof the log keeping issues.\nThe United States Navy: 200 Years, Captain Edward L. Beach, USN (Ret.), 1986, page 421, 443.\nLog Book, USS R-14, Jan. 1, 1921 to Dec. 31, 1921, page 255.\n29\nDerived from a table in Seamanship, Navpers 16118, June 1944, Chapter 7.\n30\nLog Book, USS Chicago and S/M Base, Jan. 1, 1921 to Dec. 31, 1921, page 308.\n27\n\n28\n\n89\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\n4. The Absence of Clarke. The R-14\u2019s officially assigned Commanding Officer was Lt. Vincent Arthur Clarke, Jr., the boat\u2019s only CO since her commissioning and a Navy Cross awardee from WWI. Clarke was a hot-running up-and-comer and had been recognized early on by Nimitz as someone he needed on his undermanned division staff. Several months prior\nto the May incident, Nimitz informally pulled Clarke to his staff as the division Engineering Officer, without relief available for the R-14 (see Part\nOne). The loss of the experienced and capable Clarke would have been\nkeenly felt aboard R-14, compounding the difficulties brought on by the\ninadequate billeting described above and greatly increasing the workload\nof Douglas and Gallemore. In addition, the two officers had lost immediate\naccess to an experienced mentor and capable leader and now had to handle the boat for the most part on their own. To be fair, Nimitz would not\nhave taken this action if he did not believe that Douglas and Gallemore\ncould handle the boat; indeed they were both very highly regarded. However, it can be said that even the wise and capable Nimitz could be blinded\nas to the true level of expertise of the two men by his own pressing staff\nneeds and by their own natural confidence in themselves. Douglas and\nGallemore\u2019s experience level was such that they handled the routine inand-out training operations around Hawaii in fine fashion, and this gave\nClarke and Nimitz the confidence needed to allow them to handle the\nsearch and rescue operation on their own. But they were still young and\nlacking the proper seasoning needed for this kind of unplanned contingency mission, and in the rushed preparations for it, this lack of seasoning became apparent. In essence, Nimitz may have unintentionally set\nthese two officers up for failure. Twenty-twenty hindsight being what it\nis, it may have been a good idea to send Clarke back to the R-14 for the\nduration of this important mission; surely, he could have been spared\nfrom Nimitz\u2019s staff for ten days. On the other hand, with more than half\nof the division\u2019s boats not capable of getting underway, perhaps Clarke\ncouldn\u2019t be spared. Nimitz\u2019s thinking on this is not known.\n5. Underway Watch Standing. One of the officers must always be on duty\nwhile underway as the Officer of the Deck. The absence of Clarke for this\noperation forced Douglas and Gallemore into a \u201cport and starboard\u201d OOD\nwatch rotation, meaning each man was the other\u2019s relief. Normal watch\nrotation at the time was four hours on, eight hours off. This was obviously\n90\n90\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nnot possible with only two men, and thus they were forced to improvise a\nwatch schedule that would keep one of them on duty at all times but still\nallow adequate rest. The logs indicate that the two men varied this rotation considerably for the mission, sometimes standing four-hour\nwatches, sometimes eight hours, and even twelve or more hours per\nwatch. This lack of a set schedule has an enormous disturbing effect on\ndiurnal cycles. The end effect was that the two men were constantly sleep\ndeprived and operating on the edge of exhaustion. While this would not\nhave had an effect on 02 May, the day they fueled the boat, it very well\nmay have played a factor in them missing or discounting obvious signs of\nfuel system derangement during the days leading up to running out of\nfuel on the 11th.\n6. Material Condition of the Boats. The R-class submarines were a product of the Electric Boat Company (EB) of Groton, CT. The R-14 herself had\nbeen built by an EB subcontractor in Quincy, MA, called Bethlehem\nQuincy (BQ). EB was the premier civilian builder of submarines in the\nworld and the Navy heavily relied on them. Since 1900 they had developed a near monopoly on submarine construction in the US, and in doing\nso, they had also developed a reputation of building boats with less-thanoptimal features and construction quality.31 The R-14 had been in commission for over 18 months and during that time she had been run pretty\nhard. Opportunities for comprehensive maintenance had been lacking,\nand the long trip to Hawaii from California had worn all of the SUBDIV 14\nboats down. In May 1921, of the division\u2019s ten boats only four were able to\nget underway for the Conestoga search and rescue mission, and even those\nfour boats were suffering from various maladies. In interviews with two\nof Gallemore\u2019s grandsons, the authors confirmed that the R-14 was in\nrough shape in May and was in great need of a thorough overhaul. The\nPearl Harbor Navy Yard was still in an early development stage at that\ntime, with some facilities not yet built and others still under construction.\nA few submarine tenders rotated in and out of Pearl Harbor and that\nhelped with maintenance, but in general, the overall material condition\nof the SUBDIV 14 boats in May 1921 was not good. Constant maintenance\n\n31\n\nUnder Pressure, A.J. Hill, 2010, page 10.\n91\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nissues strained the crew, affected the performance of the boats, and prevented adequate training.\n\n92\n92\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nTHE AFTERMATH\nNimitz, being the meticulous and conscientious officer that he was, would have\nbeen keenly interested in the incident and would have wanted to know the hows\nand whys. A submarine under his command had been hazarded at sea and Naval\nRegulations required him to conduct an investigation. Rear Admiral Shoemaker,\nthe 14th Naval District commander, would have also wanted some answers. Shoemaker was the senior officer in Hawaii at the time and overall responsibility for\nthe Conestoga search and rescue operation in the Hawaiian sea frontier fell to him.\nHe had been interviewed by a reporter from the Honolulu Star-Bulletin on the 16th\nof May once it became known that the R-14 had arrived in Hilo. He expressed confidence in the boat\u2019s imminent return and said that he did not know why the boat\nwould have been out of fuel. Getting his name on public record would have undoubtedly made Shoemaker very interested in getting to the bottom of the issue\nand would have insisted on Nimitz conducting a timely investigation. The authors\nhave no doubt that Nimitz actually did so, but in conducting research, it was determined that the National Archives had no record of any such proceedings on file,\nand it is not mentioned at all in E.B. Potter\u2019s highly regarded 1976 biography Nimitz. So, what follows is in part informed speculation on the authors\u2019 part and part\ninference based on known facts.\nNimitz would have begun the fact-finding immediately after the return of the\nR-14 to Pearl Harbor, most likely no later than the 18th or 19th of May. He would\nhave called into his office Clarke, Douglas, Gallemore, most likely all four of the\nR-14\u2019s Chiefs, and a representative from the fuel facility. His adjutant and an enlisted yeoman would have also been present. Interviews of all the principals\nwould have been conducted, and pertinent documents like the logs would have\nbeen reviewed. At the end, we are confident in saying that Nimitz would have\ncome to many of the same conclusions that we have spelled out so far. The most\ndifficult decision left to Nimitz at this point was what to do about it.\n\n93\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nNimitz would have been within his rights to recommend either Douglas or Gallemore, or both, for court-martial proceedings. That was an extreme step, and\ngiven the circumstances of the incident, there was a real chance that it would not\nhave gone well for the two lieutenants. However, we believe that Nimitz called\nupon a past experience to guide him in his decision.\nIn 1907 as a newly commissioned ensign, Nimitz was given command of the\ndestroyer USS Decatur (DD-5) at Cavite in the Philippines. At just twenty-two\nyears of age, the move by Admiral Uriah Harris to give Nimitz command was virtually unprecedented but justifiable by Nimitz\u2019s impeccable record up to that\npoint. Nimitz did very well with the Decatur until the evening of 07 July 1908. Prior\nto entering Batangas Harbor that evening, Nimitz failed to check the tide tables\nand badly overestimated the tide level. He also only used his seaman\u2019s eye to judge\nhis position visually and failed to take the necessary bearings to verify where he\nwas. The end result was that the Decatur ran aground on a mud bank. After attempts to free her failed, Nimitz and the crew calmly waited until the next morning when a local steamer came by and pulled them off. Nimitz dutifully reported\nthe incident and was promptly relieved of command in order to stand court-martial. The subsequent trial found him guilty of \u201cneglect of duty\u201d, but taking into\naccount the poor state of the charts for the Batangas area and Nimitz\u2019s prior spotless record, he was sentenced only to a public reprimand by the local area commander, who decided that the proceedings themselves constituted a public reprimand and thus no further action was taken against Nimitz. He had figuratively\ndodged a bullet and was returned to full duty status.32\nThe benevolent result of the court-martial undoubtedly influenced Nimitz\u2019s\ndecision regarding how to handle the R-14 incident. He was faced with a narrow\nline to walk, and in the end, he navigated it brilliantly.\nTo begin with, and most importantly, the R-14 and her crew had been hazarded\ndue to neglect. With just slightly different circumstances the incident could have\nturned out very badly. The fact that it did not was irrelevant. Obvious mistakes\nhad been made by the crew, mistakes that in wartime would have been fatal. Nimitz could not just let that go without some sort of action. Taking no action would\nhave sent the entirely wrong message to the rest of the boats in the division that\nsloppy log keeping, inattention to detail, and failure to follow procedure would be\nNimitz, E.B. Potter, 1976, page 59, 61.\n94\n94\n\n32\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\ntolerated and sanctioned. A message, loud and clear, needed to be sent to all of the\nboat\u2019s crews to tighten up their operations immediately.\nTo counter that, Nimitz came to realize how brilliantly the entire crew of the\nR-14 had performed in recovering from the incident. Douglas and Gallemore in\nparticular refused to give in to despair or acrimony; they came up with an innovative and novel solution, and they provided the leadership and guidance needed\nto get the boat and the crew back home intact. When combined with their previous\nunimpeachable career performance, Nimitz realized that he had two highly capable officers in front of him \u2014ones who could have excellent careers if allowed to\ncontinue to serve. Ruining their careers with a court-marshal would not only do\nthem a great personal disservice, it would also negatively impact the Navy as a\nwhole.\nNimitz would have also recognized his own role in this. He had been blinded\nby the big picture needs of the division and the submarine base and had failed to\nrecognize that Douglas and Gallemore, while outstanding officers, were not yet\nready to fully handle the R-14 under these conditions. By pulling Clarke to his staff\nwithout relief, he had solved one problem at his command but created another\nproblem on the R-14. He had set up the two lieutenants for failure.\nTangential to the problem but not unimportant, was the fact that the incident\nhad been picked up and reported by the news services. The coverage was actually\nquite favorable, portraying the crew and the Navy in a positive light. Recommending the two men for a court-martial at this point would generate some awkward\nquestions in the press. With the Washington Naval Conference on disarmament\nalready planned for later that year, the last thing the Navy needed was press coverage that could potentially degrade the perception of a professional Navy.\nNimitz\u2019s solution was multi-faceted and satisfied all of the competing issues.\nIn the blue-blood atmosphere of Annapolis in the 1920s, graduates were very socially conscious, and moving up to command means that they also moved up in\nthe all-important social rankings. Indeed, the comings and goings of military officers were routinely reported in the social columns of most major newspapers.\nRealizing that both Douglas and Gallemore needed further guidance before being\nfully ready for command, yet still needing Clarke on his staff, Nimitz got orders\nwritten to transfer Lieutenant Clifford H. Roper from command of the R-13 (SS90) to the R-14. Roper was a highly regarded and experienced CO along the same\nlines as Clarke. Literally walking down the pier from one boat to the next, he\n95\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nwould take over the R-14 until such a time as both Roper and Nimitz were satisfied\nthat Douglas and Gallemore were ready to move up. Even though he had been the\nActing Commanding Officer for some time, officially denying command to Douglas was a personal rebuke that sent the message that Nimitz wanted, without the\ncareer damaging legal proceedings on his record. The transfer of Roper to R-14 and\nthe denial of command to Douglas sent a message to the rest of the officers on the\nsub base waterfront that there were consequences to sub-par performance, and\nthat Nimitz was not going to tolerate it. The lateral transfer of Roper, generally\nfrowned upon in a service that promotes the concept of \u201cmove up or move out\u201d,\nproved to have little effect on him personally, as he went on to have a distinguished naval career, including major command billets and combat action in\nWWII.33\nNimitz realized that they had to cater to the press somewhat. Wanting to assure\nDouglas that he recognized that he had been put into a bad situation but had performed brilliantly, Nimitz had a Letter of Commendation drawn up for him. This\nwas a pointed attempt by Nimitz to soften the personal blow to Douglas of not getting full command of the R-14, and to let him know that he still had faith in the\nyoung officer.34\nLastly, the authors are convinced that Nimitz and Clarke insisted that when\nthe official logs were typed up at the end of the month that the amounts listed for\nfuel onboard and fuel used reflected the actual amounts that were onboard and\nnot the amounts that the crew thought they had on 01 and 02 May. This would\nserve to ensure that the historical record was accurate, and it would also deflect\nany blame that may come their way from any subsequent investigations into the\nmatter.\nRoy Trent Gallemore came out of the incident in fine shape. His career continued in the Navy and submarines, including eventual command of the R-15 (SS-92).\nIn the mid 1920s he transferred his commission to the Naval Reserve and returned\nhome to Bartow, Florida, to help his recently widowed mother publish the Polk\nCounty Record. He remained in the Naval Reserve and was called back to active\nduty in 1940. Nimitz had retained a favorable opinion of Gallemore in the years\nRoper commanded the heavy cruiser Chicago and received the Navy Cross for his \u201cextraordinary\nheroism\u201d after she was torpedoed at the Battle of Tassafaronga 30 November 1942.\n34\nR-14 Underway, Under Sail, Naval History Magazine, August 2004 issue, LCDR Robert G. Douglas,\nUSN (Ret.), page 61.\n96\n96\n33\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nsince the incident. In the summer of 1945 Gallemore was recuperating from an\nillness at a naval hospital in Hawaii. While out for a stroll in his robe and pajamas,\nRoy passed the five-star Fleet Admiral Nimitz, who paused and greeted him by\nasking, \u201cRoy! How are you doing and how is your wife?\u201d35 For a prestigious Admiral like Nimitz to pause and take the time to acknowledge and inquire about an\nofficer he knew from twenty years prior was taken by Gallemore as a sincere compliment. At the war\u2019s conclusion, Gallemore was stationed in the Micronesian islands where he developed a deep affection for the people and their culture. In 1954\nhe retired from the Navy Reserve and accepted a position with the Department of\nthe Interior. He returned to Micronesia, which included former battlefields in the\nNorthern Marianas and Caroline Islands, and he faithfully served the US government and the local population there for the next ten years. He was instrumental\nin the process of transitioning the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands to the fully\nindependent Federated States of Micronesia. He fully retired in 1965 and returned\nto Bartow, where he passed away in 1977.\nAlexander Dean Douglas had a long and varied career. The R-14 incident had\nlittle discernible impact because by 1925 he was back in Hawaii to officially command the R-3 (SS-80). He later commanded the larger and more capable S-44 (SS155) and S-38 (SS-143). He also conducted shore duty tours in Portland, OR, and\nWashington DC. By 1938 he was the Executive Officer of the submarine tender\nHolland (AS-3), and in 1941, he was the first Commanding Officer of the submarine\ntender Fulton (AS-11) as a full Captain. In 1942 he had moved up further, serving\nas a convoy commander for troop convoys to North Africa. He retired from the\nNavy in 1947 and lived a peaceful life until his death in 1989.\nR-14\u2019s official Commanding Officer during the incident, Lieutenant Vincent A.\nClarke, Jr. had a very interesting but unfortunately short career. After being\nawarded the Navy Cross for his persistent and aggressive command of the submarine L-10 (SS-50) during WWI, Clarke had earned the reputation of a highly capable and outstanding officer. He performed admirably on Nimitz\u2019s staff at Submarine Division 14 and continued his excellent service in the submarine community\nuntil 1925. In that year, looking for a new way to serve, he asked for and was approved for a transfer to Naval Aviation. After earning his wings of gold, he was\naccepted for airship duty and trained in balloons and non-rigid blimps. As a USN\nrepresentative he made the second voyage across the Atlantic on the German rigid\n35\n\nEmails to authors from Bruce Gallemore dated 28 May 2021, and 11 August 2021.\n97\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nairship Graf Zeppelin in the summer of 1929. On that voyage he made friends with\nfamed polar explorer Sir Hubert Wilkins, who later made an attempt to reach the\nNorth Pole via submarine. By May 1930, he was in command of the rigid airship\nUSS Los Angeles (ZR-3). In the summer of 1932, he transferred to the San Francisco\nNavy Yard. Shortly thereafter he became ill and was hospitalized. Blood poisoning\ncaused his health to rapidly deteriorate. He died peacefully at the Naval Hospital\nthere on 10 August 1932. He was survived by his wife Charlotte and one daughter.\nThe R-14 herself led a mundane but useful life after the sailing incident. She\ncontinued to run training operations out of Pearl Harbor until December 1930,\nwhen she departed the islands for the last time and headed east. The boat and her\ncrew arrived at the submarine base in New London, CT, in February 1931, and for\nthe next ten years, they conducted training missions for students at the Submarine School. In 1939 she was featured in a Life magazine article highlighting life\naboard a submarine. In the summer of 1941, as war loomed, the boat shifted\nhomeports to Naval Station Key West, FL. R-14 ran training missions in the Straits\nof Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Yucatan Channel for the Navy\u2019s Sound\nSchool. She also ran anti U-boat patrols in those areas, although none were ever\nsighted or attacked. By the spring of 1945 the 25-year-old R-14 was thoroughly\nworn out and with scores of brand-new fleet submarines now in the fleet the old\nworkhorse was at the end of her days. The Navy decommissioned her at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 07 May 1945. The hulk lingered there until 1946, when R-14\nfinally and unceremoniously succumbed to the ravages of time and the scrapper\u2019s\ntorch. The submarine that provided lessons to her crew and the Navy by finding a\ngood and favorable wind now belonged to history.\n\n98\n98\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nLESSONS LEARNED\nIt is often said in the 21st century Navy that Navy Regulations and procedures\nare written in blood. The inference is that the enduring lessons are unfortunately\nlearned the hard way. While thankfully no one was killed or injured in this incident and no equipment was lost or even damaged, there are still lessons that can\nbe applied to modern operations; because as Winston Churchill put it, \u201cThose that\nfail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\u201d\nFirst, the necessity of maintaining a proper log was dramatically emphasized\nhere. It is distinctly possible that a transposed digit in fuel usage or the absence of\none or two numbers was the root cause of running out of fuel. All sailors, from the\nnewest Fireman/Seaman up to the Commanding Officer must be thoroughly indoctrinated with the indispensability of proper and accurate logs. Not only will\nsmall errors in logs grow into bigger errors later, it also goes a long way toward\ndemonstrating professionalism.\nProcedural compliance was just as important in 1921 as it is now. Procedures\nare there for a reason. They will assist in reducing the effect of human nature, and\nthey will make the organization more efficient, safe, and mission effective. Failure\nto follow procedure in this case gave us an interesting historical footnote to debate. In wartime, the result would have been tragic. On the other hand, it is indeed\nironic that Douglas and Gallemore saved the boat with a technique for which there\nwas no procedure. That in itself is a corollary lesson. Procedural compliance need\nnot paralyze a sailor\u2019s actions when innovative, outside-the-box thinking becomes imperative.\nRelated to procedural compliance is the idea that \u201cqualified does not equal proficient\u201d. It is distinctly possible that the R-14 ran out of fuel because one or more\nof her qualified crewmen missed signs of fuel system derangement because of a\nlack of proficiency in the operation of the system. It has also been shown that both\nDouglas and Gallemore, while fine and highly capable officers, were not yet ready\nto command under these conditions. There is a tendency to believe that once the\nwatch station qualification procedure is completed and signed off by proper authority, the sailor is instantly proficient and experienced. Those two qualities only\n99\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\ncome with time and proper mentoring. The members of the crew that are truly proficient, such as the senior officers, chiefs, and senior petty officers, must continue\nto monitor newly qualified personnel to ensure that the training took hold, and\nthat procedures are being followed. Human nature dictates that \u201cqualified\u201d personnel, who have a desire to validate the trust that has been placed in them, will\nbe loath to admit that they are unclear on an issue or not fully proficient. Followup mentoring and training will ensure that the training sets in properly.36\nAboard modern USN warships there is a watch position called \u201cFuel King.\u201d This\ncrewmember is thoroughly trained in the operation of the fuel system, and when\nfuel is taken on board or moved from tank to tank, the Fuel King is the person in\ncharge. This establishes a clear line of responsibility to the Engineering Officer\nand up to the Commanding Officer. It eliminates the old saw that says, \u201cIf everyone is in charge, then no one is.\u201d While the authors have yet to determine the exact\norigin of the watch station, we strongly believe that the institutional memory of\nthe R-14 incident may have been the nexus for the creation of the Fuel King position in the USN.37\nChester Nimitz\u2019s handling of the situation and its aftermath was a model of\neven-handed fairness. Yes, mistakes had been made and a warship had been unduly hazarded, but he took the time to consider the mitigating factors and the circumstances involved. In a moment of self-reflection, he also saw that his own actions played a part in the mess. He recognized the qualities of Douglas and Gallemore and knew that when all things were considered, these two men were outstanding officers that could have brilliant careers in the Navy if allowed to do so.\nHe deftly walked the line between discipline and fairness and the results are unimpeachable. The authors have seen a tendency in today\u2019s Navy to conduct witch\nhunts when mistakes are made, with a level of disregard for circumstances and\nmitigating factors. It is the old monster of the Zero-Defect Mentality, and it has an\nextremely debilitating effect on crew morale.38 We consider this to be one of the\nstrongest take-aways from this incident. Mistakes are okay under certain\nA Report on the Fighting Culture of the United States Navy Surface Fleet, Schmidle & Montgomery,\n2021, page 14.https://www.cotton.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/navy_report.pdf\n37\nThe earliest reference to \u201coil king\u201d we could find online was Our Navy, the Standard Publication of\nthe U.S. Navy, page 26. 1920. https://books.google.com/books/content?id=FIM9AQAAMAAJ&pg=RA10-PA26&img=1&zoom=3&hl=en&bul=1&sig=ACfU3U2irSOgY9EjlYb_IWsC0CFqGy9ekA&ci=366%2C580%2C282%2C58&edge=0\n38\nReport on the Fighting Culture\u2026, page 9.\n100\n100\n36\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nconditions, and oftentimes, can be completely forgiven because they can be one of\nthe most powerful learning experiences a person can have. Recognize the inherent qualities of sailors, and if they can be saved, do the utmost to save them because they are the future of the Navy.\nOptimal manning of warships is one of the most difficult tasks that faces any\nnavy. Having too many sailors aboard ship is cost-prohibitive and creates management issues for the chiefs and officers. With too few sailors a breeding ground\nis created for inefficiency, overwork, low morale, and dangerous operating conditions. There is admittedly a fine line to walk, but failure to do so can have serious\nconsequences. The R-14 clearly could have benefited from not only an enlisted\nyeoman, but from at least one more officer billet. Pulling Clarke off the boat for\ntemporary duty at the division was, in hindsight, a bad decision that exacerbated\nan already tenuous manning problem. Today\u2019s USN struggles every day with\nmanning issues, trying to mitigate economic and technological factors. The R-14\nincident is a reminder of the consequences of not getting it right.\nMaintenance of warships is a never-ending task. If not done completely and\nefficiently it will have a serious deleterious effect on mission capability. Sixty percent of the SUBDIV 14 boats were unable to get underway for a life-and-death\nsearch and rescue operation due to deferred or incomplete maintenance, and\nthose that did, like R-14, were struggling with seaworthiness. Maintenance must\nbe a priority for the USN. That was true in 1921, and it is still true 100 years later.39\nFinally, the United States Navy exists solely, when taken to its core mission, to\nseek out and destroy those who would do this nation harm. The USN of 1921 had\nlost touch with that purpose, wrapped up in the euphoria of the aftermath of \u201cThe\nWar to End All Wars\u201d and the false promise of broad-based disarmament. Not\nknowing exactly what to train for will result in training that is at best ineffective.\nA military service should not train to fight the last war, and it can\u2019t train to fight\nthe next one unless it has a clear vision of what the next war will be. Establish a\nstrategic vision and provide the country\u2019s military forces with the resources necessary to train to that vision. Anything less will result in pernicious routine, malaise, and potential tragedy.\n\n39\n\nIbid, page 16.\n101\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nPOSTSCRIPT: THE FATE OF THE\nUSS CONESTOGA (AT-54)\nIt was unknown at the time, but the warships that sallied forth from Pearl Harbor in May 1921, to search for the Conestoga in Hawaiian waters never had the\nslightest chance of finding her. The Conestoga\u2019s exact fate remained a mystery for\nninety-four years.\nShe got underway from the Mare Island Navy Yard on 25 March 1921, bound\nfor American Samoa with a transient stop in Hawaii, a laden coal barge in tow.\nShortly after departing San Francisco Bay, she sailed into a fierce gale. Strong\nwinds and heavy seas buffeted the ship. Her Commanding Officer, Lieutenant\nErnest Larkin Jones, sought temporary shelter in the lee of a cove on South Farallon Island, in the Farallon Island chain just thirty miles from the Golden Gate.\nThey didn\u2019t make it. Heavily battered by the mountainous seas, the Conestoga sank\nwith all hands just three miles from the cove. There is a distinct possibility that\nshe was dragged down by the coal barge she was towing. In essence she had dipeared without a trace. Communications foul-ups and missed clues caused the\nNavy to lose track of her. Weeks passed until an alarm was finally raised. The\nNavy made an assumption that the ship was much farther west; thus, the ultimately futile search that was made in Hawaiian waters. On 30 June 1921, all further attempts to find her were called off and the Conestoga was officially declared\nlost with all hands, cause and location unknown.\nIn perhaps the luckiest shipwreck find of the century, her wreck was stumbled\nacross in 2009 by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\nexpedition that was on a general survey of the Farallon Islands looking to document other known wrecks in the area. At first unsure of what they were looking\nat, the NOAA team was intrigued by her unique silhouette and came back for a\nfollow-up in 2014. Photographic and video evidence was studied and the team,\nstunned by the facts, concluded that they had found the grave of the Conestoga.40\nConfirmed by the Navy in 2015, this 94-year-old mystery has been laid to rest and\nSmithsonianmag.com, March 23, 2016, author Suzy Khimm\n102\n102\n\n40\n\n\fA GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND\n\nthe families of the missing sailors now know the full story of their loved ones.

A SHORT HISTORY OF\nPIGBOATS.COM\nIn the late 1990\u2019s Ric Hedman had discovered eBay and out of curiosity and a\nlong-standing fascination with submarine history he did a search for [submarines] and discovered a multitude of images, most of which didn\u2019t really catch his\nattention. He did see a number of images of older submarines and they began to\nintrigue him. He came across a small personal photo album with pictures of several K-class submarines. Making a bid he eventually won it. When the album arrived it was discovered that the photos were quite small so Ric electronically\nscanned them so that he could enlarge them to see better detail.\nRic was just learning about web page construction at the time so he placed the\nimages all on one page and uploaded it to the web. He posted a link to the photos\nfor his fellow sub sailors on a bulletin board site. That was the beginning of what\nwas to first become a web page called \u201cThrough the Looking Glass: A Photographic\nEssay of U.S. Submarines, 1900-1940.\u201d In 2000 a fellow submariner by the name\nof Dave Johnston emailed Ric to comment on a particular photograph and some\ninformation that was in the background of the picture. That lone email started off\na twenty year collaboration and a strong friendship. Both men had an abiding interest in submarine history and they shared a strong desire to get it right.\nIn 2005 Ric purchased the internet domain \u201cPigBoats.COM\u201d and transferred all\nthe code to there and retired the old domain. In 2019 Ric and Dave became full\npartners in the site and have since collaborated on several published articles on\nsubmarine history. The photographic resources of the site have caught the attention of numerous authors, and Ric and Dave have consulted with these authors on\ntheir projects, providing photographs and technical reviews. PigBoats.COM continues today as one of the premier sites on the web concerning this early period of\nUSN submarine history.\n\n109\n\n\fJOHNSTON & HEDMAN\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nOFFICIAL U.S. NAVY DOCUMENTS\nLog Book, U.S.S.
