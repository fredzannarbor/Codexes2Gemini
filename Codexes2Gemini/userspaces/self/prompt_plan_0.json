      "context": "ASIA IS A FOUR-LETTER WORD\n\nI dedicate this book to the countless thousands of Asians I have met during my long life living amongst you.  Many of you called me your friend and I reciprocated to the best of my ability, sharing your joys, hardships, courtesies, shelter, food and, dare I say it, at times a deep affection.  Alas, most of you who shared my life are no more but you took a tiny piece of my soul when you were gathered, especially those Gurkhas I served with; you are alive in my mind as I so often remember your names and army numbers of yesteryear.\n\tTo those few of you who regarded me as an enemy I, in retrospect, now believe there was nothing personal in your attempts to kill me but merely you regarded me as a representative of those with whom you could neither agree nor atone.  The reverse was certainly true in my case: the one guerrilla I personally captured wanted to be my son.\n\tWithout you all my life would not have been as deep, meaningful, prolonged, rich or happy as it has been.  I feel blessed: thank you.  But my particular, personal and privileged thanks go to my surrogate son and my \u2018eyes\u2019, Buddhiman Gurung, who looked after me, paying intimate personal attention to my private needs and always with loving care on trek and in the lines when I was losing my eyesight until I could see nothing.  It was his love that sustained me and kept me from doing anything stupid \u2013 yes, I was tempted; I can never fully repay him, his wife, his children and his relations later at home, however hard I try.  This we all understand and accept; seldom can agape have been stronger or more enduring.  Without it I would never have lived long enough to have written this book.\nBACKGROUND\nThe one-time editor of the journal of the Royal Society of Asian Affairs, the late Professor V C Funnell, a much travelled and erudite scholar, wrote to me urging to commit myself to paper with \u2018something like a memoir, of years spent in active service in Asia, with the Gurkhas, or in Indochina \u2013 a kind of recollection in tranquillity, lessons learnt, a world so changed\u2026  I think there is a place for the personal account (through one man\u2019s eyes) rather than always political/economic stuff.  It could certainly have a military flavour, and it could draw wider implications about, say, how states behave, impressions of particular leaders, or monarchs or PMs and so on\u2026\u2019\n\tWhen I started to write this book I had spent nearly eighty years in Asia, almost half that time as a soldier.  During such a long time memories warp.  It is germane to quote Professor Arthur Marwick, who is quoted in Addison, Paul, and Calder, Angus, editors of Time to Kill, The Soldier\u2019s Experience of War in the West 1939-1945, Pimlico, London, 1997, (ISBN 0-7126-7376) that \u2018oral history is eleventh out of twelve types of primary source.\u2019  \n\tIn no way is this a life story as such but a series of vignettes, not always in correct sequence, based on what I think will appear unusual, droll or unlike most people will neither have experienced nor even thought of, from the time I was bold and fearless and full of blood and thunder until I am old and hairless, full of thud and blunder.  My aim has been to include those parts of my life that were of sufficient interest but space precluded their inclusion.  Some of my details inevitably have already been published but I hope to give them here with a different slant.  Anyway, only a masochist would want to read more than one of my books but even so, if you were to find a passage you already know about, you can always skip to the next lot of ***s.\nTEXT\nMy life in Asia officially started on the 8th of June 1944 when, aged eighteen, I embarked on SS Maloja, an antiquated troopship lying off the coast of Scotland, to go to India.  I had been in the army since 2 April 1943 as a Recruit, a lowly Private soldier, an unpaid Lance Corporal and now I was an Officer Cadet.  If anybody had then told me that I would spend the next eighty years of my life in Asia, with nearly thirty-eight of them in the army, in war, near war, near peace and in peace, I would never have believed him and accused him of talking nonsense.\n\tBut it happened!  Now with less than two years off my century, living in Nepal with Nepalese citizenship my mind goes back fifty-six years to when I was commanding the British Army\u2019s Jungle Warfare School, JWS, in Peninsular Malaysia.  I had students from all five continents but mainly from Europe and Asia who had to be taught the rudiments of living, moving and fighting against an Asian enemy in tropical, rain-forest terrain \u2013 \u2018jungle\u2019 to you and me.  It was then in 1970 that The Economist, having visited and been briefed by me, published that I was \u2018one of those gifted, dedicated eccentrics the British Army has the habit of spawning.\u2019\n\tI was often asked \u2018what is the Asian mind and how does it differ from the European one?\u2019  There could not be any sensible or cogent answer to the question except, maybe, to say \u2018what, in Asia, is God\u2019s Law in Europe is Sod\u2019s Law\u2019 so leaving plenty of banana skins for the unwary, the ignorant or the plain bloody-minded to slip on.  After all, \u2018Asia\u2019 is a four-letter word, for both the mindful and mindless.\n\tWhen asked by people why I have described such a vast area thus I have to admit that a certain section of the British working class would use a certain four letter word starting with \u2018f\u2019 and ending in \u2018k\u2019 as a term of opprobrium \u2013 but never forgetting the padre who gave a sermon about \u2018love\u2019 being a four-letter word; so there you have two meaning poles apart, both of which can be applied to various aspects of Asia.\n\tAs Commandant of the JWS I found a marked difference in the approach of my British and white Commonwealth students and my Asian students to the Counter Revolutionary Warfare that we were teaching them.  The differences, I found, were that \u2018western\u2019 troops were not under the normal constraints of their home environment but, even so, creature comforts were at a premium.  Their upbringing was in an environment of confrontational politics so they had a more direct approach and were more critical than, and had less respect for, \u2018authority\u2019 than Asians.  An appreciation of the bawdy was shown when I summed up the final eight-day jungle exercise to an all British course I reminded them that at the beginning of the course.  I had said that I had stayed alive because I was basically suspicious and took a fundamental approach to jungle work.  My punch line was: \u2018Fellows, it was hard and it was good.  As the Good Little Girl said to the Bad Little Girl, \u201cis it hard to be good?\u201d the Bad Little Girl said to the Good Little Girl, \u201cit\u2019s got to be hard to be good.\u201d\u2019  I had a wonderful reception and a number of sergeants came to me later to tell me it was the best exercise summary they had ever heard \u2013 but woe betide my respect among Asian students had I dared to talk like that to a similar all-Thai or all-South Vietnamese course.  The joke I made at the end of my first opening address to the Thais would never have been made by an Asian.  I \u2018got away\u2019 with it as it was both unexpected and, despite my rank, I was a European.\n\tWesterners can be snide: the Americans said that the Thais were \u2018the nicest people money can buy who play at their work and work at their play\u2019.  A Thai riposte of \u2018Americans are not polite\u2019 would, in Thai eyes, be the more damaging remark.  Asians take life with a dose of magic, westerners only accepted what in those days I called a \u2018slide-rule\u2019 mentality which needed everything to be quantified and qualified.  Many westerners at soldier level, in Asian eyes, are idle, noisy, wasteful, always sound angry, often appear unnecessarily stupid and seldom seem to realise when personal decorum has been violated.  True, but only to a point.  Certainly I have seen more British troops stoned out of their minds reeling about that I ever have Asians.\n\tI would tell my British students that Asians were tied by family considerations to the extent of appearing selfish, partisan and uninterested in Higher Authority.  A Vietnamese proverb has it that \u2018the king\u2019s writ stops at the village gate\u2019.  Nonetheless, there was more formality in a Chinese family than in a modern western one.  Surrender leaflets dropped during the Amnesty of the Malayan Emergency depicted a renegade son coming out of the jungle, giving up his weapon to the police and going home where his delighted father rushed out of the front door and fell on him joyfully.  Quite wrong.  No father would have behaved in such an undignified manner.  He would be a laughing stock and hardly worth returning to.  The leaflets were not a success and, when their inadequacies made known to Higher Authority, they were withdrawn.\n\tNot that philosophy as such affected \u2018the ordinary man\u2019 but mind-sets always play their part in the way people react.  As has been said, \u2018One can\u2019t argue with a frame of mind\u2019.  Taoism makes the Chinese see that the most important part of a cup is the space where the liquid is held; one never sees the same river twice as the water is always changing; knowledge is not to know.  Westerners see that as devious if not plain stupid.  Many Asians unused to westerners \u2018say so much by leaving so much unsaid\u2019 by hint, inference, gesture, implied meaning and ambivalence.  The \u2018man in the paddy field\u2019 is normally not inquisitive, only stoic, and has a degree of non-involvement resulting from many centuries at near starvation level when to reach the age of three is a victory.  Truth is like a Himalayan peak.  Lovely to look at, seems different from different angles, needs a tremendous effort to get there and, once there, to stay is to die so it is incumbent to descend.  Laughter is as much a cover for anger or embarrassment as well as a display of humour and a display of gratitude an induced reaction, however much the person felt it inside.  In very poor countries, even to tell a stranger one\u2019s name is to give an advantage needlessly.  \u2018And, Gentlemen, never forget the wisdom of the oppressed: to bend is not to break but to survive; to be rigid is to break and not to survive.  Amen.\u2019\n***\nShortly after I left the JWS in 1971 with what I have just written wriggling in my mind, I \u2018hid\u2019 in Ootacomund in southern India, during the Indo-Pak war and, while waiting for it to finish, had time to research in the town library, which I found had been functioning as far back as 1815 so was at least one hundred and fifty-six years old!\n\tMy quest was to see if I could find any definitions of the words \u2018Asia\u2019 and \u2018Europe\u2019.  The nearest I got was to a probable derivation was from prehistoric Semitic-Babylonian \u2013 Asu meaning \u2018sunrise\u2019 and Erebus meaning \u2018sunset\u2019.  This meant that the terms were originally what? \u2018points of a moveable compass\u2019 so had no geographical significance.  Only in the Middle Ages would Europe equate to Christendom and as The Economist Newspaper (dated January 21-27 2023) wrote that many people saw Asia by what it was not rather than being intrinsically positive.\n\tEven though by the time I went on pension in 1982 I sometimes failed to understand some aspects of Asian life, only south and Southeast Asia at that, I felt I had been accepted by those with whom I had contact.  This was helped by my having nine Asian languages firmly \u2018under my belt\u2019: Hindi, Nepali, Cantonese, Malay, Temiar, Iban, Thai, Vietnamese and Lao.\n\tThat the word Asia is only a loan word in Asian countries can be seen from how various countries grappled with it as people heard it, it being foreign to them: Asiya in Arabian, Persian and Urdu; Esiya in Bengali and Gujarati; Ajia in Japanese; Yaxiya or Yazhou )in Mandarin Chinese and Ah Sai Ah or Ah Chow in Cantonese.  All are fairly near in sound to each other.  (The abbreviated forms Ah Chow (Cantonese) and Yazhou (Mandarin) are almost always used.  Listeners may pause to think if the full names Ah Sai Ah and Yaxiya are used.  This applies whether colloquially or in formal writing.)\n\tSuperficial contacts with Asians were, of course, constant and easy to make but it took time to find any Asian with whom I could engage on more than friendly terms.  This became almost normal once I had mastered his language to a degree of reasonable fluency.  In the main I found my overall knowledge adequate, but there were instances when the conflicting demands of military common sense, protocol and expediency meant I had to rely more than I liked on luck rather than on judgement to reach an equitable relationship.  If I found a situation that would have driven a European ape I could look at it as an Asian and not be mentally disturbed: if I found myself regarding a situation that would have sent an Asian ape, I changed mental gear to a European mind set.  That saved me both much stress and duodenal ulcers but did show that I did not know the \u2018Asian\u2019 mind as well as I would have liked and, the better to identify the areas of my inadequacy.  Over the years I have asked myself whether I knew enough about Asians to ensure my approach was correct and, if not, did I know enough to correct my approach.\n\tOne thing I did find was that when any Asian schooled in Europe thinks and talks in a European language, Europeans understand him.  If, however, the speaker\\s thoughts are based on his native tongue when he speaks English (or French), he imparts a strangeness that is hard to define and makes his meaning difficult to grasp.  The same process also works in reverse to an Asian audience.  This can explain why there may be divergences of thought when, on the surface, none exist.\n\tWith all this as a background I at last turned to the individual.  The Dalai Lama, in the foreword he wrote for a book, put that \u2018there is a glass curtain between Asia and Europe which prevents sense and touch while distorting, colouring and clouding\u2026\u2019  Sometimes it allows no communication at all; only occasionally is it removed.  What is surprising is not that there are so many differences but that there are so few.  Any one personal characteristic applicable to a typical European can be found applicable to a typical Asian, if either person ever existed: greed, love, hate, fear, the whole gamut of human emotions are to be found.  I have found that the idea that the Devil will have more influence over a person if he knows his real name exists in southern Ireland, Nepal and among the Temiar.  Face, that display of public potency that makes for personal prestige, may well be a classic Asian trait but disparage a European\u2019s favourite football team or cast aspersions on his manhood being like a windsock on an aerodrome on a windless day and he will be discountenanced, losing face.\n\tAnother feature of the Asians I know is why change that which has been with people for a long time, is seen as the Devil you are used to and quite like may not really be a Devil, which has been accepted as part of the order of things, for one who professes friendship but yet behaves suspiciously like a Devil you don\u2019t know?\n\tThe European tends to become more positively involved in matters that do not directly concern him than does the Asian; likewise the former tends to be extrovert, the latter introvert.  Family probably means more to the Asian than to his European counterpart.  Gratitude is a conditional reaction, disappointingly absent when expected yet kindnesses shown are usually long remembered.\n\tThere are three areas where I have found differences most marked> the first is in the Asian acceptance of, nay demand for, a living religion, which is in powerful overtones when compared with a European\u2019s scant and pallid performance.  The second is the self-evident relationship of \u2018correct social protocol\u2019 between the sexes in public, and third is the European\u2019s insatiable desire to quantify, qualify, justify and compartmentalise any and everything whereas the Asian will accept things as they are, content to accept whatever the gods give as magic, natural phenomena or plain bad luck. is how I have heard Nepalis accept unexpected and sometimes unpleasant inconsequentialities of Providence.\n\tWhilst in the army I served in the country of a Christian King \u2013 and his Christian Viceroy \u2013 a Moslem King, a Buddhist King, a Hindu King and a Communist President with no religion.  I, a baptised Christian, have been made an honorary Hindu and an honorary Buddhist and, unknown to me, Buddhiman put my religious details on the prescribed form for Nepalese citizenship as Animist.\n\tLanguages: amongst the myriad people I spoke with over these long years, were Malay with the Sultan of Brunei (having to use \u2018hamba\u2019, \u2018your slave\u2019, instead of \u2018I\u2019); Lao with the King\u2019s sister\u2013in-law on whether her daughter was eating enough; the King of Nepal in Nepali about his late elder brother\u2019s compassion towards me; Hindi to all and sundry in Cowbell country; an Iban head-hunter in Iban so saving myself from being decapitated; in Hong Kong in Cantonese when helping compile a population census; Thai when lecturing the Thai secret army in Laos, some officers being my old JWS students; Lao when lecturing the Royal Lao Army Staff and Command College; Vietnamese when interrogating a North Vietnamese Army \u2018rallier\u2019 to the South; Temiar to stone-age aborigines who could only count up to three despite their four fingers on both hands; and French, trying to stop French colonial troops from torturing innocent peasants \u2013 and if possible English to non-Englishmen never.\n*\nAs far as my having to work with a score or so of different Asians when in the army, I knew that, vital though it is, knowing your man is only the half of it; your man knowing you is the equally important other half, for only then can there be profitable communication, nay, empathy is absent without it.  Besides this and those ever-required fundamental characteristics of sincerity, good manners, integrity, impartiality, understanding and, when possible, humour, there is little else bar experience that is needed.  My motto for dealing with everybody, particularly Asians is \u2018do as you would be done by\u2019.\nOnly in my dotage have I come to the conclusion that, whatever else Asia isn\u2019t, it is a four-letter word. So that is my ultimate description of it.  With that as a background and because I have greatly profited by and much enjoyed my Asian contacts, friendships and experiences to the extent that I would like others to enjoy them too...  \u2018Four letters can contain a lot, Sir, so I rest my case\u2019 with a personal memoir of an adult\u2019s lifetime spent on military active service and in retirement in Asia \u2013 recollections, recalled in tranquillity, of two worlds, one changed and the other as it has been for centuries \u2013 as seen through one old man\u2019s eyes as he looks back with gratitude at challenging, rewarding and memorable happenings often denied to others.\nINDIA: 1944-1947\n1***\nLet me begin by saying that the stupid thing is, I was never meant to go to Asia in the first place.  In early 1944 I was detailed for officer training in England but just before I was due to go I was sent on a two-week anti-gas course.  On my return I was told I was now on a draft of one hundred and twenty cadets to go to India for training against the Japanese in Burma: the voyage out, escorted by an aircraft carrier and destroyers into the Atlantic, was unforgettable, as was, when going through the Mediterranean \u2013 the first or second since the African campaign? \u2013 when we had to take evasive action from German planes.  Going through the Suez Canal, where the troops shouted out \u2018Who\u2019s king back there now?\u2019 and \u2018you\u2019re going the wrong way\u2019 and our witty answers such as \u2018Send your washing back home?\u2019 and the Red Sea where it was so hot the boat had to steam back for an hour an evening to get some less hot breeze into our stuffy mess decks and a stoker rushed on deck, screaming, before jumping overboard to drown, a day\u2019s shore leave in Aden, where it rained for the first time in seven years and over the Arabian Sea to Bombay.\n\tOn board we were lectured on the Indian Army and taught Urdu by a British lieutenant of the Indian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers: Urdu\u2019s unfamiliar Arabesque twang was too exotic for me to digest mentally and I was told to leave the class and be his batman or do galley fatigues.  I told him I\u2019d do the latter and told the latter I\u2019d do the former, played hooky for two days and scrubbed the mess decks until we reached Bombay as a punishment for my waywardness.\n\tBombay!  The gateway to India!  How romantic it had sounded from afar but how sordid it looked and how horrible it smelt from close quarters.  I gazed in fascinated horror at the crowds of teeming humanity, ever milling, scantily dressed and, for the most part, volubly gesticulating, excitably demonstrative or silent and depressingly poor.  The turbans, the beards, the dhotis, the shirts outside the trousers, the pyjamas by day could become unnoticed features of the every-day landscape.  What jarred then, and still do, were the pitiful, the blind, the beggars, the wheedling children, the laden women, the scavenging dogs, the bare-ribbed horses pulling over-loaded gharries, their bulb horns honking mournfully, the old and rheumy-eyed, the young prematurely shrivelled, ever eddying and swirling in kaleidoscopic patterns in the monsoon-laden, fetid air.  The raucous black crows and cows wandering in the streets with an air of indifference were the only living creatures seemingly unaffected by the heat, the clamour and the squalor.\n\tDoors on Indian railway carriages open inwards and it was fun to sit on the steps, in a cooling breeze, watching the landscape go by.  The three-day rail journey north to Delhi then on to the Indian Military Academy, the IMA, at Dehra Dun, merely enlarged the canvas.  The beggars at the railway stations, maimed, blind, clothed in rags and underfed, the mangy, slinking curs, the skeletal cattle, the impoverished shacks, even using boiling water from the engine to brew tea, all jarred my senses.  At dawn on the second morning the rails were so slippery that the wheels could get no traction and the train could not get up a gradient.  We were ordered out to push it up, which we did until we were attacked by a swarm of wild bees.  It was another world, one totally alien to me.  Even the lightning on the horizon was taken for flashes from Japanese artillery fire!\n\tI had a letter of introduction to the Viceroy, Field Marshal Lord Wavell, given to me by my great-uncle, a one-time classmate of the Highest in the Land.  \u2018Give this to Archie,\u2019 had been my instructions but, even as I looked furtively at the imposing address on the envelope as we waited for our train to Dehra Dun at Delhi station, I knew that the gap between the Viceroy and me was wider than the one between Dives and Lazarus.  I never did use it and, many years later, burnt it unopened.\n\tAnd so, more than a month after we left England, we arrived at the IMA, our home for the next five months.  We were met by the three Captains who were going to teach us and who wore exciting new cap badges and shoulder titles.  The expressions on their faces as they regarded us, travel-worn and pale, long-haired and badly turned out, the first-ever course to come en masse from England, showed us as much enthusiasm as we had shown for the Bombay crowds.  They struck us as incredibly young compared with their grizzled counterparts on the Home Establishment.  Not one word was spoken until a gorgeously starched wonder, a Major, leisurely strolled over to us but, instead of any word of welcome, it looked down its nose and drawled, \u2018If you want a pee, go behind that hedge there.\u2019  We had arrived.\n2***\nOnly now did those earlier lectures given us on the troopship on the Indian Army penetrate my insular mind and begin to make sense.  It was only when these different peoples were produced in the flesh that I could equate a name with a type.  It had never occurred to me that by no means did all Indians speak Urdu as their first language.  The majority of India\u2019s millions speak their own.  I found I could get on with the local people I came into contact with when I tried out my smattering of Urdu as and how I could but it was not yet enough for a proper conversation.  Our demonstration troops-cum-exercise enemy were the Gurkhas of Nepal.  We were told that Nepal was, and always had been, a sovereign Himalayan state, nothing to do with India or the British empire, with entry forbidden to all outsiders; that, ever since 1815, the Gurkhas had come down from their mountain villages to join the army because they liked service under the British.  It was paradoxical that neither group could then visit, let alone serve in, the country of the other\u2019s birth or domicile.  Wherever else did this situation pertain?  We heard that they were the most loyal and the bravest as well as being tractable, and that they were apt to chop their enemies\u2019 heads off with a deadly knife called a kukri.  It took a long time for an outsider to be accepted by them, after which there was nothing they would not do for that person.  People said that it was a great privilege to serve with the Gurkhas who were seen as superior to most, if not all Indians, and equal to if not better than the best the British Army could produce.\n\tThey were short men, with skins coloured brown to wheaten, shaven-pated with smooth, round faces, high cheek bones and almond eyes and I first them talking to each other as  they were squatting in a group.  I, struggling with the compulsory Roman Urdu and not managing at all, listened in awe to the staccato grunts and atonal ululations of their normal conversation.  How could anyone understand, let alone speak, such a language?\n\tThey emanated a presence and showed an inner strength which fascinated me but, so overwhelmed was I at their professionalism and high standards I had previously seen, I told myself I would never be good enough for service with them.  Despite their attraction, they were not for me \u2013 or was it I was not for them?\n\tOnce our training had started we found what the old lags had said was true, \u2018the scene changes, but the music never\u2019.  For elementary subjects we were taken in hand by gnarled British warrant officers and sergeants who told us that \u2018when in Rome you do as India does.  Get it?\u2019  And get it we did.  The officers taught us tactics and jungle warfare.  I can well remember on one patrol exercise in bushy country telling another patrol I was working with that I would let them know where I was by making cuckoo noises with my hands.  Unfortunately, a live cuckoo heard it and answered each time I called.  The other patrol got hopelessly lost and failed to complete the exercise.  Later in Malaya it never occurred to me that such birds did not live there and so my cuckoo noises were obviously man-made and not natural, thus allowing the guerrillas we were chasing to escape.\n3***\nOne Saturday evening a couple of us got into a tonga and went to the Silver Grill restaurant for a meal.  There was uproar when some drunken ex-Chindit British soldiers came in and started saying what cowards the Gurkhas had been.  The Military Police came to arrest them: I dissuaded them from taking them away and locking them up and recommended a more kindly approach.  As regards the \u2018cowardice\u2019 of the Gurkhas, I later learnt that only one officer of the Gurkha battalion being referred to spoke fluent Nepali and that none of the others knew enough of the language to brief their soldiers \u2013 who remained ignorant of the aim of their operation the whole time.  Ignorance, not cowardice.\n\tOn another occasion a Major who wanted to be with a good-looking cadet went with him to a drinking place but decided to take off his Major\u2019s badges of rank on his shoulder flaps.  Unfortunately he only took one off and when the military police came to take him away for drunken and indecent behaviour, he had forgotten that he had taken off his rank badges, or rather one of them, and pointing to his empty, rankles shoulder, haughtily demanded who the hell they thought they were talking to a Major.\n\tThe last we heard of him before he left the IMA was that he had sent fire to his mosquito net when, smoking in bed, he had fallen asleep.\n4***\nSix weeks or so from the end of our course, we were asked to give three regiments we would like to be commissioned into, as well as stating if we wanted to go to the British Army, Indian Army or be attached to an Indian regiment yet commissioned into a British regiment.  I really had no idea so I sought advice from the Company Second-in-Command, a man named Griffiths who had been at school with my elder brother Tim.  Although I might be one of those about whom it could be said that his men would follow him if only out of curiosity, he told me not to go to a British unit as any experience in the Indian Army would stand me in good stead.  However, I was advised not to go into the Gurkhas as \u2018linguistically, you\u2019re not yet even up to speaking Urdu\u2019, let alone my having to learn any second language.  So I decided to ask for a commission in the British Army but to be attached to an Indian regiment, dismissing the idea of Gurkhas entirely.\n\tI therefore applied, along with five others and advice from Captain Griffiths, for one of three Indian regiments.  A letter was sent to the depot of the 13th Frontier Force Rifles with our names, and recommendations.  I was number five on the list.  Even though there was talk about Indian independence sometime in the future, it meant nothing to us.  In those days, as far as I can recall, we did not read newspapers, nor did we have access to news from a wireless.  The political situation made no impression on us: we were intent on being commissioned and getting to the war, if only to prove ourselves to ourselves.  However, as the future was murky (not so much as to the outcome of the war by then but what would happen to India and when) most of us volunteered to be commissioned into a British Army regiment and then be attached to the Indian Army.  This is what I did.  As I remember it, only a few of my batch were commissioned into the Indian Army.\nThree weeks before we were due to be commissioned I was given a telegram.  So badly written was it that I could not properly decipher it but it looked as though Tim had been awarded a decoration for bravery.  Excitedly I went to the local post office and asked to see the original.  I was dismayed to read that he had been killed in action.  We had been so close.  He had never wanted to be a soldier and hated violence.  What a waste of a life of such promise.  I had no details of what had happened.  After so many years all that I still most vividly remember is, over the next forty-eight hours, feeling an infusion of his spirit into me.  I probably acted oddly because people would look away when I was near and, a week later, I was sharply brought back to reality by a withering rocket from one of the officers for not trying and did I want to be relegated?  But, how it happened is still a mystery, with Tim\u2019s spirit magically inside me, however hard work the learning process was, I spoke languages as though I were a native of those countries.\nSix months after his death I received two letters he had written to me.  My head whirled and I felt a hammer blow of hurt in my heart: were the reports of his death untrue?  No.  I wondered if I should open them or not.  Open them I did and read them.  I still have them somewhere...too precious to throw away.\n5***\nDespite never contemplating serving with Gurkhas it was to the 1st Gurkha Rifles (1 GR) I was attached.  After being commissioned we went on two weeks leave, I with the same Captain Griffiths of the Dogras who had been Tim\u2019s class mate at Shrewsbury School.  On the narrow gauge railway from Khasauli (the only place where rabies jabs could be given then) to Simla I saw the door of the goods van swinging open.  On a narrow bend I called out to the engine driver and told him.  He stopped the train, I got out, ran to the goods van, shut the door, climbed back into my carriage and, once again calling out to the driver, off we went.\n\tAt Simla we spent our time in the guest annex of the viceregal lodge and one day I went up Jacko Hill, on the top of which is a Hindu temple, looked after by, so rumour had it, an unfrocked English Roman Catholic priest.  Rumour also had it that this man had power over the three separate groups of monkeys who lived on Jacko Hill, either to make them desist from any attack they were making on a person or to egg them on if he thought that the person concerned had been teasing them.  On my way up I saw a European striding along the path, dressed in Indian clothes, head on chest, rapidly approaching me.  I stopped until he was opposite me and greeted him, \u2018Good afternoon, Father\u2019.  He momentarily checked his pace and turned his head towards me.  He looked me straight in the eyes and I saw his were a deep purple colour and twice the size of any other eyes I had ever seen.  I was terrified and ran away, pausing only when I was well round the next corner.  For one who had been taught how to lead men in battle this was a serious blow to my morale and self-esteem.  It had to be rectified.\n\tAccordingly, next afternoon I went up again, this time with Captain Griffith\u2019s bull terrier bitch.  Once at the temple at the top of the hill we were surrounded on three sides by monkeys who advanced threateningly towards us.  Terrified we ran away, down the only open track, but were stopped by unfriendly cattle.  I jumped over the side of the hill and slithered down, in seven minutes, the distance I had previously taken over an hour to cover.  At least the bitch had the advantage of not having gone though the bottom of her trousers.  \u2018Peace hath its defeats as well as war\u2019.\n6***\nOn 27 December 1944 I reached the First Gurkha Rifles Regimental Centre (GRRC) at Dharmsala, later to become famous as where the Dalai Lama took residence after fleeing Tibet.  The narrow-gauge track down from Simla gave way to the broad-gauge railway in the plains.  At one station I went to have a look at the engine and the driver saw 1 GR on my shoulders and asked if that stood for Indian Government Railways?  This was not as bad as the British Service officer who thought that DOGRA on a shoulder title did not refer to the eponymously named regiment composed of Hindu Dogras who live\u00a0predominantly in the Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir, and in adjoining areas of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, but stood for the Duke of Gloucester\u2019s Royal Artillery!  Then I changed again on to another narrow-gauge line that wound its way through low hills to the railhead at the small town of Pathankot.  From there it was a road journey of about fifty miles, along a gently rising valley until a steeper climb for the last three thousand feet into the clear, crisp air, where pine and rhododendron forests vied for supremacy and Simla was a hundred miles away across the haze.\nThe Regimental Centre was situated at about five thousand feet above sea level, had been built, temporarily, in the last century, and had been added to until it had spilled into some of the lower valleys.  The men\u2019s rudimentary lines had long been condemned but finance, that age-old bogey, stalked with deadening effect here as in so many other places in the Army of Hind.  There was no electricity or running water.  A backlog of subalterns had been waiting, some for more than a year, for a posting to an active battalion.  It seemed that I, too, would be stuck there for ages.  Meanwhile, I was posted to a recruit training company to learn the rudiments of all that which is needed to be a commander of Gurkhas.\n\tI had to come to terms with that quintessential aspect of the Indian Army, and indeed the Brigade of Gurkhas today, namely kaida, the proper way of doing things in a tightly knit, well-organised extended family that a good unit is.  Each unit has its own kaida.  In the Regimental Centre it was stiff and reeked of pre-war snobbery.  Officers with \u2018temporary commissions\u2019 such as I had were known as \u2018temporary gentlemen\u2019 and the toast to the King Emperor on Mess nights was prefaced, more than once, by \u2018Gentlemen and Temporary Officers\u2019.\n\tIn early January 1945 fourteen feet of snow fell in two days.  Roads were blocked for miles around and, if they remained impassable, rations would be in short supply.  Recruits were formed into gangs and armed with plates, there being a woeful shortage of spades and shovels, used them to open the road leading up from the plains.  No military work could take place.  The young Gurkhas had not been away from home long enough to lose their freshness so the nearest any of us got to training for war was when one gang ambushed another with a barrage of snowballs.\n\tThose who had had boots issued wore them, sodden, uncomfortable and strange.  Those with no boots wore sandals.  The lads, none over eighteen years of age, had ever worn boots before.  One made the mistake, not only of putting the boots on the wrong feet, but lacing them together.  The first step he tried to take saw him crashing down onto the ground, bursting his nose open.  He was taken to the hospital, admitted and issued with a shroud as well as pyjamas.  The Irish doctor did not think he would die because of a sore nose but he had been found deficient of shrouds on the last inspection.  Determined to leave nothing to chance, every person admitted to the hospital had to sign for one \u2013 just in case.  This practice had to be stopped when it was found to have a depressing effect on morale.\n\tOne Saturday a British officer and his English fianc\u00e9e were married in the local church of St. John in the Wilderness.  We all paid a share, based on rank, for their present.  That done, and not knowing the officer or the lady in question, two of us youngsters decided it would be much more fun to go for a long walk.  We presumed that our absence would not be noticed, but it was.  We had not been guilty of any military offence, only of a grave social solecism.  We did not know how to behave as \u2018sahibs\u2019, did not know the kaida and our presence was no longer required in the Regimental Centre.  Although it had never occurred to me that that would be so, it was yet another twist of fate as, shortly afterwards, my friend and I, to the envy of those who had been trying to leave for months past, found ourselves posted down to the plains to the Training Division south of Dehra Dun \u2013 from the back of beyond in the middle of winter to the middle of nowhere at the start of the hot weather.\n\tHere, nearer the war, I felt that training was more realistic than was the case at the Regimental Centre in its remoteness, shadowed by snow-covered mountains.  Here we lived in the same section of the camp as the men so had plenty of chance to find out more about them and their language.  Training was based on warfare in the jungle prior to our joining an active battalion in Burma.\nI was not happy with the heat.  Our accommodation was small thatched huts, with mud walls two feet high, topped by a thick rush trellis and roof made out of the same material, a haven for the tiny sand fly that gets into the eyes, bites with an itch and is a pest.  Bathing facilities were rudimentary; a hipbath in an enclosed corner of the hut.  Mosquitoes were in plenty and there was a squad of men whose job it was to spray every hut from time to time.  I had, earlier than usual one afternoon, got into the hipbath when one such squad was on its rounds.  The leader came into the \u2018bath room\u2019 to spray the walls.  As he left, he redirected his spray and gave me a squirt aimed at my unmentionables.  So flabbergasted was I that words failed me.  By the time I had recovered my wits the squad was away and, in any case, I was hardly dressed for pursuit nor had I the vocabulary to sustain a verbal barrage.\n\tHad anyone suggested that I would voluntarily undergo any hot weathers after the war was over I would have told him not to be crazy.\n\tWhile still under training \u2018Victory in Europe Day\u2019, known to the Western world as VE Day, came and went: I arrived.\n\tCelebrations included a feast in each company.  I was thirsty when I arrived and the light was dim.  The metal tumbler I was offered seemed to contain water and I swigged a large mouthful, thinking it was water, my natural choice of drink.  I was taken completely by surprise and the sheer violence of the stuff choked me before realising that it was raksi, colourless country spirit.  I asked for some water and, when more colourless liquid was poured into another glass, did a repeat performance.  Here was a new saheb being tested.  After two tumbles full of raksi for the first time in my life I became gloriously drunk and found, to my delight, that I could converse fluently with the men, understanding them and they understanding me.\n\tA regimental nautch was a replica of Hill culture where women did not dance.  Young men took their place.  Costumes were stylised to reflect male and female performers.  Each unit had its own nautch clothing and make-up.  By midnight I found I was the only British officer left and I was inveigled to dress up as one of the dancers.  I soon mastered the rhythm of the dance and found myself singing a song, the refrain of which was repetitive and the key refrain word was the meaningless relimai\u00f1 and that became my nickname for many years.  When it was all over, so I was told next morning, I was carefully taken to my accommodation, undressed and put to bed.  I had been accepted: I now belonged.\nBURMA: 1945\n7***\nThree of us left India in late June 1945 to join first battalion of the First Gurkha Rifles (1/1 GR)  in Burma.  Rangoon had just been liberated so we went by boat from Calcutta to Rangoon, then by train, through Letpadan to a small village, Othegon.  We were met by an open Jeep and the driver took us away and stopped outside a house on stilts and told us that that was where the sahebs lived and that the Commanding saheb was looking out of an opening at us to see who had arrived.  Feeling glad we had arrived safely and to show the face looking at us how lithe I was I jumped out of the back of the Jeep \u2013 only to catch my foot on the side and go sprawling.  Not a good start but not as bad as one of the others, named Frank Brooks: next morning at breakfast, still sitting at the table, the CO opened that rarity, an airmail copy of an English newspaper, and started to read it.  Frank lit a cigarette and holding the match away from him, neatly started burning the CO\u2019s treasured newspaper...\n8***\nOne unusual incident still sticks in my memory: on one patrol in the foot hills of the Pegu Yomas we came across wounded and starving Japanese lying beside the jungle track.  Another of our patrols had gone farther on and we wondered if there was a danger of their being outnumbered.  Using a Japanese-English phrase book I sat next to a wounded man and, opening the correct page, asked him the strength of Japanese troops to our front.  He studied the page of answers and gave a very large figure.  As I studied the phrase book I found, much to relief of us all, he was telling us his army number.  At the same time he surreptitiously tried to reach for his pistol to shoot me but my vigilant Gurkhas foiled him.\n9***\n\u2018May we stop and buy a horizontal bomb?\u2019\n\tI turned to my Gurkha driver and asked him to repeat his request as I was sure I had not heard him correctly.\n\t\u2018May we stop and buy a horizontal bomb?  There\u2019s a mobile canteen on our way back and I can get one there.\u2019\n\tIt was shortly after the atom bombs had been dropped on Japan in the last days of the war.  We were on our return to Battalion HQ from HQ 20 Division in Henzada, where I had been sent to collect a rarity in those days, an issue of beer.  I had been serving with Gurkhas for all of eight months and had managed a fair degree of fluency, but this beat me.\n\tWe could spare the time and I was intrigued.  We soon reached the canteen, one of a small fleet of converted trucks that visited units.  Run by a gallant band of women called the Woman\u2019s Auxiliary Service (Burma), it provided a basic and much appreciated service of necessities and, until they ran out, \u2018char and wads\u2019 (tea and sandwiches).  I told the driver and his mate to go and see what was in the canteen and get a cup of tea.  I sat back and waited.\n\tOn my arrival in Burma, having steeled myself to fight the Japanese and reluctant to postpone my first \u2018moment of truth\u2019, I had found the situation quiet.  I fretted over the inevitable anticlimax caused by unexpected inactivity but I dared not be bored.  A soft breeze stirred some metal strips that hung at the top of a pagoda opposite the parked vehicle, producing little ringing jingles, tinklingly mellifluous.  There was a fragrance in the air, whether from joss or wild flowers I cannot remember.\n\tAs I mused about being so near the war though not yet a part of it, the two Gurkhas came back, looking slightly forlorn.  They said that the canteen was no good as it did not have what they wanted.  I sympathised.\n\t\u2018Didn\u2019t you get any tea?\u2019\n\t\u2018Oh yes, we got our tea all right but we could not find any horizontal bombs.\u2019\n\tSo, over the noise of the engine, I had heard correctly.\n\t\u2018Do you really want a horizontal bomb?\u2019\n\tYes, they did.\n\t\u2018The memsaheb inside the canteen said that there weren\u2019t any but we think we saw some.\u2019\n\tRather facetiously I suggested it was an \u2018etam bom\u2019 they were looking for but soon realised my joke was in poor taste.\n\t\u2018No.  It\u2019s not like that.  It is small and cool.\u2019\n\tIn the end I went myself and asked one of the ladies if she had a horizontal bomb \u2013 one of the small, cool ones?  She was taken aback and, asking to be excused, went to consult her superior.  I now wished I had never stopped at the canteen, thus avoiding this embarrassing situation.\n\t\u2018What exactly do you want?\u2019  I made my strange request yet again only to be told that they had never heard of such a thing.  I asked if I could call one of my men in \u2013 \u2018just this once, please\u2019 \u2013 as they were sure some were in stock.\n\tReluctantly this was allowed (\u2018we\u2019re really too busy to answer such queries\u2019) and my driver was allowed in.  He looked around and, stiffening like a terrier scenting a rat, suddenly pounced on a small cardboard box on a shelf.  He put his hand inside and, with the air of one who has known he was right all along, produced a small bottle.\n\t\u2018Lo, Saheb, a horizontal bomb,\u2019 he said with quiet satisfaction.  I read the label which clearly showed its contents \u2013 Oriental Balm.\n\tHe paid for it and we left in silence.  Neither of us could ever know how many similarly stupid mistakes of misunderstanding were to be made between Asians and non-Asians in the future.\n10***\nThe same evening that I brought back the beer, sitting in an upstairs room of a large Burmese house on stilts we used as a mess, the field telephone clanked its authority as we started to eat our supper.  Slightly vexed, the adjutant went to answer it and then followed one of those infuriatingly elusive, one-sided conversations that had us hanging on his words even after the last \u2018good night\u2019.\n\tHe returned to tell us that the Japanese had surrendered.  Impromptu celebrations lasted well into the night so it was with a distinct jolt we learnt next morning that the message of the previous evening was wrong and the Japanese had not surrendered.  Quite the reverse, so went the new message, a large party was infiltrating to our north and we were to go and deal with it immediately\u2026\n\tPeace was declared a week later and we were thankful that the battalion had suffered no casualties during those last seven days, but that in no way countered an understandable tendency to lethargy.\n11***\nThe end of the Second World War brought peace and stability to few parts of Asia.  The turmoil of war and the inability of the colonial powers to defend what they had looked on as theirs had stirred up a new political atmosphere in the whole region.  The Japanese had shown that Asians could more than master Europeans: Asian nationalists took full advantage of the new situation.\n\tDespite victory, Britain grew tired of sustaining her colonial empire.  There were many reasons for this: emergence of new political and social forces, both in Britain and elsewhere, that were inimical to empires (unless they were thinly disguised in Communist red rather than openly-painted imperial red of the British kind); the rise of those who felt uncomfortable in positions of authority in the mould of previous establishments; the unwelcome phenomenon of \u2018debunking\u2019 much of what people had cherished in the past (patriotism, thrift, good reputation, for instance); financial crises; and a growing awareness that monumental changes were in the air all combined to make Britain start looking less far afield than in previous decades.  The French, on the other hand, were markedly more tenacious in regarding their continued hold on their overseas colonial territories, where the locals were even more against their colonial masters returning.\n\tDisengagement in Asia started with the cataclysmic events in the Indian subcontinent that resulted in the jewel in the crown of the British Empire being fragmented and handed over to two lots of home-grown masters: \u2018the greatest act of statesmanship this century\u2019, so the British Prime Minister Attlee is reputed to have said.; \u2018Apartheid in the name of religion,\u2019 said I \u2013 and haven\u2019t more deaths, more suffering and more hatred been caused by gods that are held to be true by one, false by another, than any other reason?  Even with India\u2019s open and implied abnegation of most matters British, without which India would never have been a political entity let alone a regional power, it kept on six regiments of Gurkhas and the British Army absorbed the other four, sending them, in the nick of time, to save Malaya from a completely new phenomenon: Communist Revolutionary Warfare (CRW).\n\tDespite the worldwide sands of time running out for \u2018imperialists\u2019 and \u2018colonialists\u2019, with Communism trying to fill the vacuum, apart from Communism being beaten in territory of their choosing in the Dhofar province of Oman, 1970-1975, only the British in Malaya were successful in inflicting a military and political defeat on these same communists in terrain and on terms of the latter\u2019s choosing, even when it seemed as if some of those on our side had a death wish of incompetence fostered by \u2018the slow defeat of seldom doing anything properly\u2019.  There, disengagement came ten years later than in India.  In Borneo disengagement was over and done with by 1967, leaving only a residual interest in Brunei and a completely different situation in Hong Kong until near the turn of the century.\n\tIn stark contrast to the British performance, patchy and marred though it was, in Indo-China neither the French, nor later the Americans, were successful in having their chosen people take over the reins of power.  In the East Indies, the Dutch were eased out (blaming the British for starting the rot by quitting India prematurely) to make Indonesia and the Portuguese had \u2018withered on the vine\u2019 in Mozambique and Timor.\n\tWhatever else the British do or don\u2019t do, they seem to be able to \u2018hit it off\u2019 to a remarkable degree with various ethnic groups not of or in the motherland, often better than any others \u2013 empathy between the British and the Gurkhas epitomises this.  The Americans are na\u00efve but many are totally sincere but often \u2018out of their depth\u2019 while the French are arrogant, cruel and \u2018care-less\u2019 with Orientals, to take two examples of other foreigners\u2019 approach.  In my experience Asians can be worse than either, and then to their own sort.  Western-type democracy, as Britain, certainly, and France, maybe in name only, had falteringly tried to implant in their former colonial subjects, was an alien graft, certainly in Asia.  However, it had been around longer than any American influence had been on the Asian mainland and the pathological dislike of Americans to colonialism undermined the colonial powers residual influence even more.  Added to all that, the double standards of the bullying communists made an explosive cocktail with insurgent nationalism that became old and stale even before the honeymoon had ended, often before it had been consummated.\n\tI have been asked more than once \u2018would the British have been successful if the British Army had been committed to Vietnam?\u2019  My answer is a categorical \u2018no\u2019: the end might not have come how and when it did but the Americans won most of the battles they were involved in.  They irreplaceable weakness was that they never had full control of the political system as the British had in Malaya and Borneo so when they promised independence the main plank of the Communists\u2019 political platform became invalid.  The Vietnamese \u2013 \u2018lacquered bamboo\u2019 \u2013 had a hatred of being ruled by others ever since the Chinese held sway over them in the 13th Century.  I fully believe that the magnet of communism was the only way they saw political freedom from foreigners.  It was their bad luck their new masters were, in effect, no easier to get on with than the previous colonial ones.\n\n12***\nNot long after the war ended interest was revived and pressure re-applied by orders to move to French Indo-China, to disarm the Japanese and hand the country back to the French.  Up to then our mental horizons had never been farther afield than Singapore and few of us had any but hazy notions of where French Indo-China was.  I was detailed to pay a visit to the local Burmese head teacher and find out.  He produced an atlas and I learnt where it was and that there were no less than five states with names that conjured up shades of schoolboy stamp albums; Cambodia, Laos, Tonkin, Annam and Cochin China.  We were destined to go somewhere named Saigon that few of us had heard about and none of us could otherwise have placed without that atlas.\n\tThe battalion packed up.  Official farewells to the villagers were paid and the battalion made its way by train to Rangoon \u2013 I drove the engine part of the way \u2013 ready for the next stage of its journey to an unknown country.\n\tThe Japanese had defiled the cathedral in Rangoon and the most senior priest in South East Asia Command, SEAC as we were known then, came to take a service of re-dedication.  The only time it could be arranged was at dusk but it was found that there were no electrical appliances working so all was in the dark.  Then someone senior had a bright idea: a Jeep was called and it was driven up the steps of the cathedral and a little way into the building itself.  Its headlights gave us enough light to worship more comfortably than otherwise would have been possible.\n\tIn early September we sailed in SS Rajula and five days later reached the coast of Cochin China.  From Cap St Jacques upriver to Saigon we took in details of this new land, so depressingly like parts of the one we had just left.  But now it was peace time: all seemed so calm the men did not look upon it with any more tactical interest than is inbred in soldiers who have survived a hard war.  But the calm was illusory.\nCOCHIN-CHINA: 1945-1946\n13***\nAlthough none of us knew it at the time, we were to become embroiled in what is now known as Communist Revolutionary Warfare, CRW.  Mao Tse-tung\u2019s doctrine, also practised by his formidable lieutenants-by-proxy, Ho Chi Minh, personality spokesman for North Vietnam, and General Vo Nguyen Giap, had insidiously started to spread in Asia.  It set a pattern for the next two decades and more of unrest and violence, in one guise or another.  Gone, for the most part, were the pitched battles of conventional armies as we knew them, changed were the priorities of the principles of war.  The tactic of terror needed no front line nor did the gospel of grief any slit trench.  Slogans and ideas did not fill the belly, nor rice the mind, yet hungry men spurned food and thoughtful men disdained normal logic.  What was this strange new happening and what moved men so violently?  Surely not entirely the hatred of the European, nor solely the love of revolution?  These two facets were, maybe, the catalyst that gave the impetus to swing the pendulum that moved the ratchet-wheel that slipped the cog that started to change the face of the world that British and French colonialists had built.  This was to be further changed by the two superpowers to the detriment of millions: \u2018three cheers for America\u2019? or \u2018three Tsars for Russia\u2019?\n\tIt is easy to forget that it is only when the pendulum has swung its full course does the ratchet-wheel move at all.  Movement is life, no movement is death: yet in action the reverse was often nearer the truth, and we were there to fight, not to philosophise.  When I first tried to put my thoughts together, Indo-China/Vietnam had not soured men\u2019s souls nor had the post-war rash of history books yet analysed cause and effect. \n\tNot long after we arrived it was evident that there was going to be trouble between the French civilians and the local population.  The man in overall charge of the forces in the south was Major General Douglas Gracey of the Indian Army.  His orders were to control the area surrounding the two Japanese headquarters, one in Saigon itself and the other, at Dalat, a hill station not far away.  Gracey found himself in an unenviable position, squeezed from many sides: by the French and the Vietminh (the shortened form of \u2018Vietnam League of Independence\u2019); by Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Supreme Commander, who was not only ambitious and politically motivated but was also at \u2018personality odds\u2019 with him (so he personally told me); by a Labour government in Great Britain that was not sympathetic to matters colonial and heavily in debt; by the Viceroy and Commander-in-Chief in India wanting their army back without getting involved in someone else\u2019s war; by Indian politicians to whom the presence of Indian troops helping restore French colonialism (and Dutch in Java) was anathema; and by the Japanese army which saw itself as, \u2018undefeated\u2019.\n\tThe situation quickly deteriorated as the Vietminh came to realise that the French were to be given back control of the country, and incidents of shooting were a nightly occurrence.  Both Saigon and its Chinatown, Cholon, were dangerous places.  The arrogance of the French towards their colonies, the cruel exploitation and brutal maltreatment and contempt of the Tonkinese, Annamites and others in Indo-China shown during that phase manured seeds of bitterness and frustration already sowed and a burning desire to be rid of their masters.  General Giap (a student of Napoleon), the military commander of the Vietnamese main force and guerrilla armies, who was to prove more than a match for both the French and the Americans, and Ho Chi Minh, the political boss who outwitted all adversaries, were both rampantly anti-French.  Such bitterness does not accrue overnight.  It was bitter irony for so many Vietnamese that, when the northern Communists did eventually prevail, Communism was as much a failure as it has been everywhere, with its mismanagement, corruption, privilege, repression, intransigence and cruelty on a par with the previous French colonial practice, however much Frenchmen would argue to the contrary.  The Communists\u2019 \u2018outrageous overestimation of their own worth\u2019 was a cardinal error.\n\tThe Gurkhas, who had known no other European than the paternalistic British, were dismayed by French behaviour and unimpressed by their military showing \u2013 one example being sentries who fired their weapons to let the guard commander they were awake at night.  We looked the same so why did they comport themselves with such arrogance and contempt for others?  The Gurkha answer was \u2018they don\u2019t care.\u2019\n14***\nThe name \u2018Vietnam\u2019 is back to front from its original: \u2018Viet\u2019 means \u2018to get somewhere with difficulty\u2019 and \u2018nam\u2019 means \u2018south\u2019.  \n\tThe reason for this back-to-front business lies in the inhabitants wanting to have their old name back, from Dai Viet to Nam Viet.  They had to go and ask a very senior Chinese Mandarin.  However, the official Chinese answer to the request was negative.  If, it was said, the name reverts to what it was, although we understand, our successors might not and still think it was theirs.  If, however, you want to retain the name, we will allow this but only if you have it back to front - ergo today\u2019s name.\n15***\n\u2018All Japanese forces in French Indo-China have been ordered to fly a black flag, denoting surrender.\u2019  That edict made a great impression on me, as indeed did the rules of conduct laid down for our relations with the surrendered Japanese forces: \u2018There will be no fraternising whatever between Japanese and Allied forces.  In dealing with Japanese your behaviour will be guarded and coldly polite.  You will, in the case of senior Japanese officers, use their correct titles.  You will not shake hands with them\u2026 In no case will British and Japanese officers feed in the same room, nor will tea be offered at any meeting.  Any Japanese who come to receive orders or report should be kept at arm\u2019s length, e.g. with a table between you and them, and they should not be allowed to sit at the same table\u2026\u2019\n\tAll Japanese officers had to salute allied soldiers of all ranks.\n\tTo me there was something fitting and ultimate about having a black flag.  For too long the Rising Sun of the Japanese flag had dominated too many places and now their sun was set.  The Japanese, who had swept all before them at the start of the war, had been ordered to stop fighting.  In Burma, where they had lost the war, that made sense to them.  In Indo-China where there had been no fighting, losing the war made no sense.  Luckily for the allies the Emperor\u2019s edict was final and the Japanese conformed.  The rules of conduct, the restrictions and petty embarrassments were not harsh but designed to humble by loss of face.\n\tThe Vietnamese we came into contact with, condescendingly called Annamites by the French, were small, lithe people with faces not unlike the Chinese but, in the main, darker hued.  Their language was beyond any of us; a high-pitched twittering as of many sparrows.  The only way we could talk to them directly was by using French but even that had its problems as not all of them spoke it and those who did had an accent unfamiliar to our ears.  If that was not enough, so little rapport was there between the locals and their colonial masters that we British had to speak French well enough to be understood but badly enough to be taken for someone who was not French.  We were, initially, accepted in a friendly way.\n\tThe French, pro-Vichy colonials \u2013 and who was it who so aptly said that only French colonials like French colonials? \u2013 should have been in charge of Saigon but they were so ineffectual they soon had to hand their duties over, but to whom?  We had been detailed to collect and back-load Japanese military stores, including kit from a Railway battalion and small aircraft bombs, from various installations so were unable to take on those French responsibilities.  The only people who could were the Japanese but French national pride, or what was left of it, baulked at their soldiers handing over duties to the Japanese even if the Japanese could have been persuaded to take them over from the French.  A compromise was reached: the Indian Army would take over from the Japanese in the morning and hand over to the French in the evening.  In the event all went smoothly but there was one moment of tension when one Gurkha guard commander, a naik (corporal), found that his opposite number, a second lieutenant, had to draw his sword to salute with.  Discipline on both sides prevailed but the Gurkha looked uncomfortable till the sword was sheathed.\n\tTension again surfaced that evening when the French took over from the Indian Army who were guarding the residence of General Leclerc, the senior French military officer.  A Guard of Honour from both countries was drawn up in front on either side of two flag poles.  For some reason known only to the planners, 1/1 GR had to provide a small party of men both to haul down the Union Jack on Last Post being sounded and unfurl the Tricolore when Reveille was blown.  The parade, attended by both civil and military dignitaries, was a solemn affair.\n\tAfter preliminaries, arms were presented and officers saluted.  Last Post was played and the Union Jack slowly hauled down.  As soon as that was completed the bugler started blowing Reveille.  The naik in charge of the flags had been briefed on the importance of the occasion but he had tied both knots on the French pole too tightly, the one at the base and the other that held the Tricolore.  He could not get it open with his fingers even with frantic tugging so, horror! he bent down and undid the lower knot using his powerful teeth.  The rope swung free, was tugged, but now the upper knot was seen to be too tight.\n\tBy this time Reveille had been blown and a strained look became apparent on some of the faces of both spectators and participants.  The very honour of France was at stake should her flag be disgraced.  Anxiety was palpable as the naik looked at the offending rope as he decided how to tackle this new and even more knotty problem.  He sat down, took his boots off and then, horror of all horrors, he drew his kukri.  He looked up at the tightly furled flag and, watched by us all in utter fascination as, for one dreadful moment, ghastly visions of mutilated flags and ropes and flag poles must have occurred to many.  But \u2013 tired arms still in the saluting position \u2013 he swarmed up the pole and forced the knot open with the blade, supremely oblivious that he had saved a nation\u2019s honour.\n\tThe command \u2018Order Arms\u2019 was given and the ceremony continued as if nothing unusual had happened.  After the parade, apart from a little stiffness in the arms, all was bonhomie.  The French were full of praise, vastly impressed by this show of initiative.  \u2018Ah, les Gorkhas, tr\u00e8s galants, tr\u00e8s magnifique.  Nous n\u2019avons jamais vu...\u2019\n\tProof of further nastinesses was forthcoming when leaflets (I still have my copy) were smuggled into the Gia Dinh girls\u2019 school where the battalion was billeted.  Headed SOLDIERS OF THE BRITISH ARMY, the message was short and to the point:\nAn armed conflict may occur between French imperialists and us, the Vietnamese.\nBe prudent and never ramble about with the French.\n\tSo prudent we were, nor did we ramble about with them except occasionally when we went to swim at Le Cercle Sportif, irreverently re-christened \u2018The Sporting Goodly\u2019, where the women besported themselves with more faith than elastic.\n\tOne afternoon there was a film show in town that was supposed to be anti-Vichy in sentiment, and therefore unpopular with the local French inhabitants.  In order to control any possible disturbances, I was ordered to take a platoon of Gurkhas to guard the cinema, inside and outside.  At this unexpected display of force the audience could only give vent to their feelings with some fearsome-sounding Gallic oaths.  Two hours later the crowd streamed out into the road.  A car, slowly driven by a Japanese, came past and a woman cyclist, swerving to miss an obstruction, hit it.  She fell off and immediately the French formed a circle around the car and started belabouring the hapless driver.  Reactions pent up by frustrating inactivity in the cinema found an outlet.  The Japanese sat steady, with an embarrassed smile, as blows smote him from all sides.  The woman had, by this time, picked herself up and was rapidly disappearing.  I was unhappy to see the luckless driver as a target of pent-up French emotions but I did not see how to redress the situation.  More explanatorily than with conviction, I shouted \u2018Oy!\u2019 at the top of my voice and the effect was instant.  The Frenchmen stepped back, glaring at me as I waved the Japanese on.  The engine was still ticking over and the driver needed no second bidding.  I found myself filling the vacuum and wished I had not been so impetuous.\n\tTo stop any Gallic onslaught I put my hand out and, subconsciously remembering being punished at school for getting a supposedly simple phrase wrong, brought it out unhesitatingly, loudly and with great authority.  \u2018Ou sont les bagues de la reine? which does not mean where are the queen\u2019s knickers,\u2019 I added in English so a casual observer would not be muddled as I had been in those early days.\n\tThe effect was gratifyingly startling and, before the French crowd could realise that my message was inappropriate, albeit well timed, I had reached the safety of my platoon, now reformed nearby.  \u2018What did you say?\u2019 the driver asked me as we drove off.  For a moment I toyed with the idea of giving a Nepali rendering of my few words but regretfully decided I was not up to it.  I took a side step away from the truth and said I was invoking royalty.\n16***\nJapanese units in the surrounding countryside also had to be disarmed and, at the same time, it was feared the unrest in Saigon was spreading.  Troops were therefore deployed to the south and north and it was our 100 Indian Infantry Brigade that went upcountry, its mission to disarm the Japanese.  1/1 GR was to go to Thu Dau Mot, a peaceful little riverine town an hour\u2019s normal drive from the capital, 4/10 GR to Thu Duc, a small town nearer to Saigon and 3/14 Punjab Regiment to Bien Hoa, a sleepy village to the east, on the River Dong Nai.  We moved off expecting trouble, I travelling with the Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Colonel C. E. Jarvis.  We drove through open countryside along roads badly in need of repair, with peasants working normally in the fields.\n\tThe French Army camp at Thu Dau Mot, which was empty when we arrived, consisted mainly of two three-storied buildings, two rows of cells \u2013 capable of being heavily guarded \u2013 a pleasantly sited officers\u2019 Mess and some outbuildings.  The perimeter was soon strengthened with panjis, sharp bamboo stakes, which were stuck into the ground to impale the unwary, the inquisitive and the evil-minded.  A football ground lay outside the perimeter.  The barracks were a couple of miles from the town and built on a knoll overlooking paddy on one side, mixed jungle and scrub on two other sides and the River Saigon, half a mile wide, on the fourth.  We were supported by machine-gunners of the 1st Royal Battalion of the 9th Jats and a section of Indian Artillery.\n\tConvoys, known as \u2018Atlantics\u2019, reached us every other day from Saigon.  I had been made Intelligence Officer and much of my work entailed visiting various Japanese installations and making inventories of items for back-loading.  With elements of the navy, the air force \u2013 complete with an arsenal of 60 and 120 kilogram bombs \u2013 to say nothing of part of a Railway Company as well as more conventional army units, my work was unusual and interesting.  Apart from my own Gurkha staff, I was also in charge of a small intelligence cell comprising an Annamite woman and two half-caste men.  A French Army liaison officer, Colonel Turk, who had come from Madagascar, lived with us, practising his English.  He was a narrow-minded, obstinate man who seemed to despise anyone not a European, so found himself at odds living in a Gurkha battalion.  He was inclined to obesity, was of medium build and had a bad complexion.  However, he was gratified at the respect paid to him and was useful on occasions.\n\tThe local Vietminh guerrilla units were becoming more and more active as they tried to assume military authority.  Roadblocks, ambushes and skirmishes dragged us into fighting when we should have been busy with our prime task of collecting Japanese stores.  On the road between Thu Dau Mot and Saigon was a village favourable to the Vietminh, named Bung.  Troops were sent there to patrol the area and prevent road convoys from being ambushed.  One day I had to visit the troops there and, as no trouble was anticipated, I only took a small escort.  Approaching an area of paddy we met scattered firing but we only saw two people, a man ploughing and a young woman.  She was standing stock still, legs slightly apart, one in front of the other, her arms upraised.  She was silhouetted against the sky and remained immobile the fifteen seconds for us to drive out of sight.  But what was curious was that she was completely naked.\n\tOn the way back a grenade was thrown from the roadside into the truck in front of me.  I saw it hit a soldier on the head and roll onto the floor.  He picked it up and threw it away, superbly unruffled.  It was a Japanese-type, lighter than the British 36 grenade, but even so the soldier was bareheaded and I presumed it would have hurt him.  He did not even put his hand up to his head to feel if there was any damage while the grenade harmlessly exploded out of range.\n17***\nThere were not enough troops both to keep the guerrillas at bay and to disarm the Japanese.  The official solution for the task of containing the guerrillas was to use Japanese troops.  As neither the two Japanese battalions in Cochin-China, the Takahashi and the Yamagishi Battalions, had any adverse war record of atrocities they were to be used both under 1/1 GR.\nIn the Imperial Japanese army a battalion, butai, took its name from its commander; the Takahashi Butai\u2019s CO a Major and the Yamagishi Butai\u2019s a Captain.  Both men were experienced and shrewd operators who had spent many years fighting the Chinese.  We came to know them well and found the restrictions imposed on us in our dealing with them irksome.  Even so, relations were cordial.  Both Japanese commanders sensed our unease and never, in any way, took advantage of our feelings.  They had to come and report to us every evening.  Their staff work, especially regarding reports, maps and diagrams, was faultless.  As Intelligence Officer, I helped with these reports.\n\tOne day Major Takahashi and his interpreter marched in, stood to attention one side of the table behind which  the CO and I were seated, bending forward from the waist as their hands came up to their hats, halfway between our army and navy salutes.\n\t\u2018Good afternoon, Gentlemen.\u2019\n\t\u2018Good afternoon.\u2019\n\t\u2018We have a report.\u2019\n\t\u2018Please give us your report.\u2019\n\t\u2018We have captured a Russian.  Shall we kill him or bring him to you?\u2019\n\t\u2018Bring him to us.  How do you know he is a Russian?\u2019\n\t\u2018Because of his uniform and because he is carrying a jar of coffee.\u2019\n\tThe information was given with the quiet authority of one who talks from a position of strength because what he says is true.  We did not follow the logic of the coffee but had the manners not to seem puzzled.  Later on we speculated among ourselves about this curious affair.  Russia was one of the \u2018big four\u2019 and an ally.  We could not believe it was capable of organising clandestine operations against wartime comrades in arms, but how wrong we were.\n\tWhen the Russian was escorted in on the morrow he was clasping a large glass jar full of roasted coffee beans.  Red-haired and stocky, he was wearing khaki drill, had a yellow hammer-and-sickle emblem on a red background on each lapel, with a similar badge stuck into his khaki forage cap.  He was put in the cells and kept there until Higher Authority told us to send him to Saigon.  We had his clothes laundered for him but drank his coffee, which was delicious.\n\tWe sent him south to Saigon three days later, he protesting volubly that he would talk to no one except the Soviet ambassador.  He would not believe us when we told him that there was no Soviet representation in Saigon.  We never heard of him again.\n\tGuerrilla activity increased in tempo.  In November orders came to send a column, code-named \u2018Clarkol\u2019 \u2013 under Major R. W. Clark, hence its name \u2013 north to a village called Ben Cat.  Its task was to locate and destroy a Vietminh force that had ambushed and caused casualties to a company of the Yamagishi Butai.  The infantry element was to be our own B Company and three rifle companies of the Yamashi.  I was detailed as the column second-in-command.  We moved north with a strong escort of armoured cars of the 16th Cavalry, commanded by Major Sawney, a versatile Indian officer who spoke impeccable English and quickly rose to great heights after Indian independence.\n\tWe reached Ben Cat in the late afternoon, after a tiring day during which many Vietminh roadblocks of felled trees had to be cleared.  Major Clark went to meet the Japanese commander at his house \u2013 the largest in the village \u2013 and was kept waiting for a quarter of an hour before he came downstairs with a \u2018comfort girl\u2019.  He was dealt with curtly.  Some of the Gurkhas spat their disgust as the Japanese m\nMajor and his \u2018keep\u2019 passed them.  Troops were settled for the night and orders for the next day were to be given only when a Japanese patrol returned.\n\tAt 8 o\u2019clock that evening elements of all interested groups assembled in the house where Major Clark had set up his headquarters.  It appeared that there was a group of about fifty guerrillas to our south in a triangle of country, the apex of which pointed to Saigon.  The gunners were to remain on the northern \u2018base\u2019 road while the Jat machine-gunners and the armoured cars were to patrol the other two roads.  The infantry, the Yamagish Butai and B Company 1/1 GR,  was to sweep southwards, spread out widely at first but concentrating as the country tapered to a point.  It was hoped to finish the operation in one day.  Major Clark, being committed to overall command, I wondered how troops would be commanded when my thoughts were rudely interrupted by hearing that \u2018Captain Cross is the commander of all the infantry\u2019.  We were to drive to as near where the Vietminh were suspected then patrol south on foot, searching for them.\n\tThe surrender terms stipulated that no Japanese would give orders to an ally.  Military common sense, however, argued against me, with only ten months\u2019 commissioned service, commanding the equivalent of a battalion, three parts of which already had a commander who was battle-proven and with no common language.\n\tI spent a restless night, going to bed with my head in a whirl.  So nervous was I that I knocked over the only lamp there was in the house and we had to go to bed in the dark.  I was severely cursed.  In a vivid dream my beloved elder brother, Timothy, who had been killed in Europe a year before, gave me advice on what to do on the morrow.  \u2018Be yourself, keep calm, you\u2019ll manage,\u2019 he told me.  I slept on comforted and was awoken at 3 o\u2019clock, refreshed.  I dressed and went outside to find the convoy assembling and the men falling in, an untidy jigsaw puzzle so cleverly putting itself together.\n\tThe convoy moved off at dawn.  I was in the leading vehicle with four Gurkhas as bodyguards.  Driving slowly along a winding road with cover on either side, shots rang out as guerrillas opened fire on us.  So much on tenterhooks was I that I was out of the truck with my four men, over a bank and towards the scene of firing before I realised it was pointless my barking with so many dogs under my command.  Even so, my stupidity raised my morale and luckily had a depressing effect on the opposition because they were seen, in the half-light of dawn, running away.  Japanese soldiers caught me up and joined in the firelight.  We did not give chase as we were on a tight movement schedule.  On we drove.\n\tWe moved off on foot dead on time.  With me were Yamagishi and his staff, including an interpreter, my four Gurkha gunmen and, on my far right, the company of Gurkhas.  One of Yamagishi\u2019s companies was on its right and the other two away on the left.  We advanced steadily through elephant grass, scrub and patches of rubber trees for about two hours with no incident.\n\tWhen firing broke out I was nonplussed.  It came from an overgrown rubber plantation in front of us, about 200 yards away.  Between us and the guerrillas the country was dense and sloped down to a small river that flowed across our front.  I looked around and tried to pinpoint the fire.  As I did a voice sounded in my ear and I turned to see the Japanese interpreter bending forward, hissing his respects, his solar pith helmet under his left arm, with a water bottle in his right hand and a Japanese-English dictionary in his left.  He was newly appointed and exceedingly nervous.   I expect we were both equally green.\n\t\u2018Respected sir, Captain Yamagishi sends his respects and respectfully requests you to adopt the lying position.\u2019\n\tLooking around I saw that we two were the only ones not lying down and, in all probability, presenting good, though small, targets.  We continued our conversation in the prone position.\n\t\u2018Respected sir,\u2019 the interpreter hissed, looking happier now he was closer to nature than originally designed.  \u2018Captain Yamagishi respectfully asks your respected permission to fire his mortars.\u2019\n\tThe interpreter squirmed away to give my respected permission and the Japanese fired their mortars for about ten minutes, after which Captain Yamagishi and I, aided by the interpreter, held a short confabulation.  I suggested, in my grandiose ignorance, a company attack.  I was respectfully asked if I would mind if Yamagishi could have my permission to send a section.  I gave it \u2013 having not much option \u2013 and was intrigued to see ten men, commanded by a second lieutenant armed only with a sword, disappear down the slope a few minutes later.  After a short while they appeared some way up on the far side, near the rubber plantation.  They cast about, turned and waved us forward.\n\tThe main body moved off downhill in extended line.  My mind was already at the top of the hill when I reached the river so I was frightened out of my wits by seeing a Japanese head come up from between my knees and my crotch and felt myself being heaved into the air.  Frightful visions of hara-kiri raced through my mind and I tried to kick out but my legs were firmly pinioned.  I really did think I had \u2018had\u2019 it \u2013 miles in the middle of nowhere, yet another young and unsung embryonic hero serving King and Country \u2013 and it took a few moments to realise that I, like the Japanese officers and my four gunmen, were being given a pick-a-back across the river to save our feet from getting wet.\n\tAt the top of the hill were two casualties, both badly wounded by mortar fragments.  In both cases a large lump of metal had penetrated near the top of the thigh and made a nasty hole in the neck.  One was a young man, armed with a rifle; the other, a lad of about twelve, held a catapult in his hand.\n\tAbout 20 yards away a section of Japanese soldiers distracted me by going through some sort of dumb pantomime.  They were excitedly pointing down to something I could not see.  I told the interpreter to calm them down.  I was distressed on account of the wounded.  We were miles from anywhere and, even to my untrained eye, there was little hope for their survival and carrying them out would badly delay us.  In Yamagishi\u2019s headquarter group was a doctor with a medical satchel.  He examined the casualties and spoke to the interpreter.  I was approached and asked if I would authorise the doctor to kill the man and the boy by injecting sufficient morphia into their bloodstream for their end to be painless, as his limited medical supplies could help in no other way.  I was appalled by being turned to for a decision and stalled.  But apparently everything was in my hands: what a way to burden a twenty-year-old\u2019s conscience!  Hating myself, I made the fatal decision \u2013 but at least it put the pair out of their misery.\n\tFeeling distraught, the antics of the Japanese soldiers, standing on the bank, grated on me.\n\t\u2018Stop them fooling about,\u2019 I said, angrily, to the interpreter.\n\t\u2018Respected sir, they are afraid.\u2019\n\t\u2018Why?\u2019\n\t\u2018They have seen a hand,\u2019 was the enigmatic reply.\n\tSo I went to see what it was all about.  The bank, maybe three feet high, had a ditch on the other side.  Rubber trees were planted on the bank and the ditch was to hold water to help their growth.  But now it was full of dry leaves and a skinny brown arm was waving about, palm upwards.  So the soldiers had seen a hand!\n\t\u2018Pull it,\u2019 I ordered callously.\n\t\u2018They are afraid to,\u2019 answered the interpreter.\n\tMy temper snapped and, sensing that valour was the better part of discretion, the soldiers were quickly ordered to pull the hand.  One man, braver than the rest, bent down ready to grasp it.  A second man caught him round the waist and a third the second likewise.  In one movement the leading soldier grasped the hand and all three pulled.  I watched, fascinated, as a small, stark naked man, with the star of Tonkin tattooed on his left shoulder, was jerked upwards, carrying a brand new machine-gun with a flat magazine.  Almost in one movement he wriggled free of his captors, looked up at the near-cloudless sky, crouched low and he bent both ends of the magazine down, so jamming the weapon.  He jumped up and down, shrieking.  The Japanese were on him in a flash.  He ceased his shouting and looked sullen.  I asked the interpreter for an explanation.\n\t\u2018Respected sir, the soldiers were in micturition\u2019, (some quick overtime with his dictionary there) \u2018on the leaves when the hand appeared.\u2019\n\tThen I understood why the man had looked at the sky on being so unexpectedly pulled out.  When he felt the sudden surges of liquid wetting him he had put his hand up to see how heavily it was raining!  The two dying casualties were decoys and he was hiding, ready to shoot us up as we moved off burdened with the wounded.  On seeing that there was scarcely a cloud in the sky, he was furious at having disclosed his position.  The gun was of Czechoslovakian origin and, had the man not made the mistake he did, he would undoubtedly have been used it against us.  I never knew what made him jam his weapon rather than try and kill us.  (In future years, when I gave South Vietnamese army students lectures at the JWS, I used this incident as an example both of the need for constant vigilance when engaged on this type of operation and of the fact that secret weapons need not always be modern to be effective.)\n\tDuring the next two hours we took about twenty more prisoners.  We were a few minutes\u2019 walk from the apex of the triangle in thick country when machine-guns of the 16th Cavalry armoured cars opened fire dangerously close.  There was no need for me to be reminded about lying down as we hit the ground as one man.  Another burst smacked overhead.  Apparently the remainder of the guerrilla groups had slipped across the road and had been seen but not stopped so the subaltern in the nearest armoured car had fired into the thick undergrowth taking a gamble of hitting more men he believed might be following behind.\n\tOnce on the road I soon met up with Major Clark and Colonel Turk.  The latter, with true Gallic courtesy, said, \u2018You were very brave, I will recommend you for a decoration,\u2019 in a heavy and guttural accent.  We quarrelled badly a month later when I strongly objected to the manner in which the then-not-so-gallant Colonel had grossly insulted the Gurkha I had detailed to be his batman.  His Parthian shot then was to the effect that if I so insisted that what he had said to that f***ing Gurkha was insulting, \u2018I will cancel your decoration.\u2019  But that was later and now he exuded bonhomie.\n\tThe drive back to Ben Cat had one incident worth recording.  The armoured escorts for the returning column had only reached the road junction at the apex of the search area a short while before my group did.  The guerrillas had dug so many holes in the road and felled so many trees athwart it that it had taken the whole day to make the road passable to vehicles as well as search the verges for ambush positions to ensure no hostiles were still in the area.  The Vietminh, as far as we knew, had all moved south so a quiet journey back was expected.\n\tFrom the opposite direction came a French armoured jeep.  It slammed on its brakes as it drew level with us and out stepped an officer, thin and foxy, limping on his right leg.  He found Major Clark and asked him in good English if the road south to Saigon was clear.  Clark told him that the Gurkhas had cleared down to the next road junction, some six miles away, but he thought it unsafe to go farther south.  He said that we were going to Ben Cat for the night and it would be dark soon.  \u2018We have a wireless set there if you want to use it.  Come back with us.\u2019  No.  He had a personal despatch for le G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Leclerc and had to get it to Saigon that night.\n\tSo saying, he hobbled back into the jeep and drove off.  The country to left and right was clear of trees.  We turned and watched him go and almost immediately there was a muffled report and a spurt of dust from a punctured back tyre.  I saw it happen.  The vehicle slewed to a halt, reversed and drove back fast.  The French officer\u2019s face was dark.  He sought out Major Clark and angrily demanded why the road was so dangerously exposed to enemy fire when we claimed that we had cleared it.  He was in no way pacified and flushed with pique when we pointed out that there was no place for a sniper for a considerable distance, that we were still standing there, safe and sound, and had not he better return with us?  He drove the few miles back to Ben Cat on his punctured tyre, not bothering to change the wheel.\n\tOn arrival at Ben Cat we dismissed the troops.  I waited until they were settled in their billets and, as I turned to go to mine, the French officer came out of a house a few yards away and strode off, neither leg in distress.  He suddenly noticed me and, stopping only momentarily, limped away with his left leg obviously causing him distress.\n\tThat night, as I drowsed off to sleep, I reviewed the events of the day, so unusual I felt I could never forget them.  I had, in a mild way, been tested, if not under exacting conditions, by much that was unexpected and strange.  While I would never say that I had been anything other than pedestrian in my military actions, I had not disgraced myself \u2013 frightened, angry and remorseful though I had been.\n\tI had faced my \u2018moment of truth\u2019, not as I had expected in Burma but in an outlandish place far from British interests and farther still from anything ever remotely imagined, and I was still in one piece, mentally and physically.  How strange it was that militarily I had come of age fighting Asians of no concern to Britain while commanding Britain\u2019s staunchest Asian friends and her most feared Asian enemies.\n\tWe drove back the next day with no incident.\n18***\nA Company of the 1st Royal Battalion of the Jat [Machine Gun] Regiment was attached to 1/1 GR and three Indian machine gunners went to buy eggs at a small house not far from the camp entrance, almost in sight of the sentry.  They were invited in by the woman of the house.  Men, in hiding, tried to overpower them.  They succeeded in subduing two of them and tied them up.  They were stabbed to death, their eyes being pierced with long skewers.  The third soldier broke loose and ran away but, in his panic, turned down the road leading away from the camp.  He was chased, captured and killed, then buried in the cemetery of the Paupers\u2019 Hospital.\n\tOne of the suspects the battalion had captured during the column up to Ben Cat was a woman.  She stayed in the camp and made up numbers to two pairs for the intelligence cell looked after by Colonel Turk.  One Saturday afternoon she came into my room.  She seemed excited.  She had some intelligence she wanted to impart.  She alleged that she knew where the body of an American officer was buried \u2013 in the cemetery of the Paupers\u2019 Hospital.  This man, Lieutenant Colonel Peter Dewey, was the senior American in our part of Cochin-China and had been killed in an ambush some months previously near Saigon.  His body had not been recovered.\n\tA report about it was sent to the Control Commission in Saigon and, on an appointed day, two youthful American officers arrived in the convoy.  It was planned to go to the cemetery on the morrow and exhume the body.  I was detailed to be in charge.\n\tThere were some Vietminh prisoners in the camp cells and early next morning I went and chose the strongest-looking bunch.  I also collected an escort from the duty rifle company and we drove down to the cemetery.  The party consisted of myself, Colonel Turk, the two American officers, the grave-digging Viets armed with picks and shovels, and the soldiers.  The cemetery was much larger than when viewed from the outside.  The woman had given us a vague idea where to look for the grave \u2013 which all looked the same - so many yards from the western end.\n\tI chose one and ordered the earth to be shovelled away.  The coffin appeared and seemed new.  The lid was forced open and revealed a blackening corpse with rotting flesh.  A sickly-sweet smell pervaded the area and one of the soldiers vomited.  We put the lid on and shovelled the earth back.  We tried again.  No luck, either, but my gaze fell on what had been a woman and before I looked away the picture of one of her breasts, which had burst open with a growth like a blood-red cauliflower and with the skin peeled back like a grotesque banana, imprinted itself on my brain.  A large, lazy, black fly settled on the maggots guzzling on her rotting flesh and the lid was banged shut.  Another man spewed.\n\tThe idea that our search would be narrowed if we only opened the larger coffins then struck me.  Earth was cleared from a third box and a prisoner told to lie on top the better to judge the relative sizes of body.  A glassy look came to his eyes and he was momentarily seized with fear.  He struggled vigorously but was overcome by the others and stretched out on top.  Poor brute!  He really did think he was going to be buried alive.  He was only kept there long enough for us to confirm that it could not be the one we were looking for as the coffin could not have contained Dewey\u2019s corpse.\n\tWe opened another coffin and I thought my search was over: as the body had been squeezed into it and the face, growing dark, suggested European features.  The dress was normal issue khaki fatigue.  The head was slewed round to one side and the body bent as though it had been an effort to fit it into the coffin.  I directed a man to turn the head because it was rumoured that it was there that the bullet had struck the Colonel and there was the suspicion of such a mark.  A hesitant hand reached down, grasped the skull and turned it.  The underside was a sordid mess, flattened by its own weight, but I thought I saw a definite bullet wound.  The Americans, watching closely, were not fully convinced.  The man, sickened by where his hand was, jerked it away.  The skull came off from above the temples, revealing decomposing mush.  The Americans then wanted to see the shirt, so I got another man (the first had retired, eyes swimming and retching vilely) to lift the arm.  He pulled too hard and the arm was jerked from its socket.  By now I was weary of it all, the heat, the stench, the sight, the flies, so I asked the Americans to stop prevaricating and state whether it was the Colonel or not.  And the only thing they had against it being Dewey\u2019s corpse was that a small piece of sacking had been tacked into the inside of the breast pocket.  \u2018That\u2019s not according to regulations so the body is not Dewey\u2019s, said one of American officers.  I was too emotionally drained to argue.  We all felt deflated for some time after we left the cemetery.  None of us touched meat for several days.  Two days later a convoy was badly ambushed as it drove past where we had exhumed the three corpses and I couldn\u2019t help wondering if the woman was a spy.\n\tNor did this macabre episode end there.  When in the United States in 1960 I tried to contact Dewey\u2019s father, then a presidential candidate, about it but was fobbed off when it was known why I wanted to see him.  Later that year I talked with General Gracey and told him how I had been fobbed off telling Dewey senior about what I thought had happened to his son.  The General told me he had expected Lord Louis Mountbatten to get rid of him because of Dewey\u2019s death \u2013 \u2018he was looking for an excuse to give me the sack\u2019 \u2013 but all that was said about the incident was to ask why the flag on Dewey\u2019s vehicle was bigger than regulation size?  \u2018I never understood Mountbatten\u2019s unexpected attitude to me.\u2019  When I said that in America the rumour was the Colonel was a \u2018natural\u2019 son whose existence might have embarrassed a presidential candidate, the General said he now, at last, understood Mountbatten\u2019s reticence.\n\tSoon after that I had to go and investigate reports of an ammunition factory.  It was almost light relief to find a humble carpenter\u2019s shop full of spears, poisoned darts and bows and arrows.  It struck me as risible, if not paradoxical, to find ourselves engaged in such skullduggery so soon after we had read reports about the mushroom clouds.\n19***\nOne morning a week before the Yamagishi Butai was to be disarmed, Yamagishi and his interpreter came to me when I was working in the stores.  I had no shirt on and was hot.  I was counting 60-kilogram bombs and he asked me to spare a minute.  He was immaculate in clean uniform and shining leather, belt and boots.  There were some Gurkha soldiers counting stores and Yamagishi signified that he wanted to see me alone.  By now there was a bond between us and, although we had never gone beyond the bounds of decorum laid down by the surrender edict, I felt that, were other situations to prevail, we could become firm friends.  Even so, the end of the war was only four months past and a tiny and uncharitable thought struck me \u2013 was this interview going to be violent?  I need not have worried.\n\tWhen we were out of sight of the others and by ourselves, the interpreter told me the history of Yamagishi\u2019s sword; the two hundred and fifty odd years it had been in his family, the five personal fights he had had with it against the Chinese and now, before the surrender parade, he was going to give it to me.  I felt too small for the occasion as, reaching out to take it from Yamagishi\u2019s hands, the interpreter said, \u2018Respected sir, Captain Yamagishi says he wants to give you his sword because you are a true gentleman and cavalier.\u2019\n\tI stammered my thanks, feeling that anything I said was superfluous.  The sword indeed had five notches in the blade.  I was also given a piece of paper on which was written:\n\tTo: Capt Cross\n\tQ.M.A.L.F.* Thu Dau Mot\n\tBrief History of a Sowrd\n\tThis sword was made by a famouth swardsmith called Fujiware yositoke who lived about 300 years ago in our country\n\tWe call these sword \u2013 Nippon-to, and this Nippon-to was a treasure of my house\n\tI used this sword as my most favourite one on this great war\u2019s battlefield\n\tEspecially this sword is being kept in ancient shape, and is very sharp on its edge\nOwner\nYamagishi Keisuke\n18th Jan 1946                     2nd Battalion Commander\n\t[*Quarter Master Allied Land Forces]\n20***\nOn the eve of the surrender parade, appropriate preparations were made.  Towards one end of the large parade square, equidistant from both sides, a flagpole was erected.  Early on the morrow the Union Jack was flown.  In front of it were tables and a row of chairs.\n\tFor the parade, the British officers stood either side of the flagpole and the Gurkha officers sat on chairs in front, the senior Gurkha officer, the Subedar Major, in the centre.  The surrender was to be Asian to Asian.  At 8 o\u2019clock the butai, led by Yamagishi, marched up the road leading into the camp and onto the square.  It formed up facing the flag and the men to whom they were to surrender, the Commanding Officer in front, all other officers six paces behind him, all warrant officers six more paces behind them, then the rank and file, at open-order, with sergeants behind as supernumeraries.\n\tYamagishi marched up to Subedar Major Balesor Rana, saluted, unbuckled his sword \u2013 his second best \u2013 laid it on the table between him and the Gurkha officers and saluted again.  His face was wet with tears.  He turned about and, one by one, the officers followed suit.  The Gurkha officers\u2019 faces were granite-hewn in their immobility.  Their expressions were a stern mask of unrelenting unforgivingness.\n\tAt a single command the warrant officers divested themselves of their swords and laid them on the ground.  The supernumeraries, rank and file, bent down and, performing the drill movement of \u2018ground arms\u2019, laid their rifles alongside their right feet, pointing towards the front.  Erect once more, they undid their leather belts and laid them down, complete with side arms.  Ranks were close-ordered, a turn to the right was made and away they marched, inscrutable no longer, as an ineffably weary slouch to their shoulders and shuffling gait poignantly expressed their inexpressible comments.\n\tA fatigue party bundled the surrendered items into the store where I had to make an inventory of them.  It was ironic that, within ten days of the ceremony, all the swords had to be re-issued to the same Japanese to cut the grass along the verges of the route used by the convoys to prevent Vietminh ambushes.\n21***\nI took two Dodge 30 cwt [hundred weight] trucks down to the market one morning with a fatigue party to buy some firewood.  A man ran out in front from behind a wall and threw a grenade under the leading vehicle.  It exploded.  The driver jumped out, brandishing his kukri and, giving chases, caught the assailant up and tried to lop his head off.  The terrified man lunged despairingly forward as the kukri streaked down, slicing off his left buttock.  The mess was frightening.  I had him bundled into the serviceable vehicle and sent up to our camp.  I waited until a third vehicle came to tow the damaged truck away.  I was upbraided by Colonel Turk, we had not quarrelled then, for making myself so obviously a target \u2018when you have a price on your head.\u2019\n\t\u2018How much?\u2019  I asked.\n\t\u2018Nor as much as I have,\u2019 he said, either with a touch of legitimate pride or merely pulling rank.\nSINGAPORE: 1946\n22***\nOn our way back to India in February 1946 I left the battalion at Singapore where I spent a week undergoing a War Office Selection Board, with a major-general in charge, to see if I, as well as about thirty others, were worthy of being made into peacetime regular officers.  Our accommodation was the grandstand of the Bukit Timah race course.  We had our own sleeping bags and were used to lying on hard ground.  The interviews took place somewhere near the airfield at Changi.  We were driven there and back through Singapore and saw the wartime destruction being tidied up by sweating Japanese soldiers.\n\tWe wondered if we could go for a ride into Malaya as we thought \u2013 how wrongly! \u2013 that there would be no chance of ever visiting the country again.\n\tIn my final interview the major general castigated me for not having served with British troops since being commissioned so I was unexpectedly delighted to be graded B.  As no one then knew what would happen to Gurkhas we were ordered to state our British regiment of choice.\nINDIA: 1946\n23***\nThis I did and waited for another boat to catch up with the battalion, now stationed in Dehra Dun, where I found myself in charge of the transport.  This consisted of five bullock carts on daily loan of which the Quartermaster always wanted three and no one wanted any, so I, two bullocks and their handlers spent our time quietly and non-productively.\n\tAn Indian battalion mutinied in central India and my battalion went down to take over.  We guarded an airfield, played football with local teams but feelings were running so high against both British and Gurkhas our battalion spectators watched with kukris, withdrawn from their scabbards.  I played left wing and when I took a corner in one match a boy put his head out to see what was happening as I kicked the ball so getting hit so hard on his head he was knocked unconscious, I was accused by the local press of being a \u2018tiger\u2019 and all Gurkhas \u2018uncivilised\u2019.\n\tThe hot weather rose to about 118 degrees Fahrenheit.  No work was done between 9 and 3 o\u2019clock. A group of anti-English Indians marched up to our camp to show their impatience at our not leaving.  They had a band with them and the only tune it played as \u2018Will ye ne\u2019re come back again?\u2019.\n\tFrom such a hot place we found it more than cold when we were sent to Razmak on the North-West Frontier at the start of the cold weather, 1946.\n*\nThe North West Frontier of India has never been tamed.  It is a wild, barren and hilly tract of land lying alongside Afghanistan.  Its inhabitants, the Pathans as we knew them then and as I still think of them (the Gurkhas knew them as \u2018Wakli\u2019), are subdivided into many families, most of whom seem to be in a state of perpetual feud with each other.  They are a proud, fierce people, whose pale eyes look arrogantly on all and sundry as they lope along with easy and graceful stride.  It is the visible sign of manhood to carry a rifle.  The guile and patience with which it was used, whenever possible, against the military had led to a number of columns having to be sent out as punitive missions from the large garrisons that had been built at other places, Peshawar, Damdil, Rozani, Wana and, farther south, Quetta.  We had to occupy hill tops before motor convoys brought men and stores up from the plains and, after their return tactically withdrawing to avoid being ambushed.  Apart from the garrisons there were a number of forts which housed the Scouts, groups of superbly trained Pathans who marched and fought as regular Irregulars, lovingly led by their British officers.  The two most famed units were the Tochi Scouts and the South Waziristan Scouts.  It must also be remembered that the King Emperor\u2019s writ only extended ten yards either side of the roads in the North West Frontier so opportunities for skullduggery were constant and often taken.\n\tDuring this time three of my friends took a vehicle and went to the club in Peshawar.  Mass killings had led to corpses being on both sides of the road.  James C, with a few drinks already inside him, saluted one particular corpse as he passed it.  On the way back he recognised it and saluted it again.  He did not see a jackal pulling the arm so was \u2018knocked sober\u2019 when the corpse returned his salute.\nA Record Office was found in Peshawar and among the charge sheets was one that stated that Private X was put on a charge by Sergeant Y for stating a falsehood in that, \u2018at......on......when asked where his bayonet was replied \u2018under my bleeding foreskin\u2019, knowing it not to be there at the time.\u2019\n\tAnother was about a subaltern at a Viceregal Ball who propelled the Viceroy\u2019s daughter backwards at a dangerous speed, with his hands on her breasts, neighing the while like a horse.  He lost two years\u2019 seniority.\n24***\nWe lived with rumours: rumours of partition, rumours of leaving British India, rumours of transfers to the British Army, rumours of officers\u2019 postings \u2013 nothing but rumours.\n\tDoubt was no new thing to live with.  In the eighteen months since the end of the war we had learnt the truth of the clich\u00e9 \u2018rumour is a lying jade\u2019.  All we could do was to carry on as though we had implicit faith in the future.  Loyalty to the oath we had all sworn meant just this.  None of us for a moment ever imagined we would, albeit unwittingly or unwillingly, join in the pell-mell rush to coincide with the politicians\u2019 countdown.  Indianisation of Indian units meant their British officers pulling out, but not us because in Gurkha units we had no Indian officers to hand over to and we could not just leave the battalion and shove off.  Abandoning men was something we never envisaged \u2013 nor had we ever been taught \u2013 but that is what was to happen.  Lucky it was for our peace of mind that this dreadful occurrence could not be foreseen, was therefore never imagined.\n\tIn the isolation of the North West Frontier, with its strictly masculine population and esoteric ritual (even to calling three-ton lorries \u2018tretons\u2019), much of what went on in India reached us as rumour or not at all.  We knew that in the larger towns there had been rioting and it had been taken for granted that Europeans would be unmolested.  However, conditions were changing rapidly and travel across India was liable to be unpleasant if not fatal.\n\tIn 1997 I had a letter from the Indian CO of my one-time battalion, 1/1 GR: ...we, the present lot at 1st/1st do remember you and your contribution to the Battalion and are grateful for the same.  In fact what we are today as a Battalion is because of all these individual brick making a magnificent and imposing edifice.  The stark reality is brought home to us every time when senior officers compliment the Battalion and hearken back to the past achievements of the Battalion.  May I therefore request you to maintain this umbilical relationship with the Battalion and honour us with your presence whenever the chords of the heart hum with memories of the association with the Battalion...\u2019  This magnificent endorsement of our efforts, especially at such a time, shows how correct our approach to the then situation was.\nNEPAL: 1947\n25***\nIn February two of us received an invitation to go to Kathmandu.  It was given by His Highness Maharaja Padma Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana, Commander-in-Chief and Prime Minister of Nepal.  I believe we two were about the one hundred and twenty-fifth and one hundred and twenty-sixth Europeans ever to visit the capital since contact was first made in 1793.  We viewed the prospect with mixed feelings; we were thrilled at the thought of the visit but dubious about travel to and fro.  We each took someone to help us: I took the Mechanical Transport Platoon\u2019s havildar (sergeant) and my friend the Intelligence havildar.  This was because both men had their house in India so there was no other way they could ever go to Kathmandu.\n\tWe were given a month\u2019s leave of absence.  After a week\u2019s eventful journey across India \u2013 by lorry to Bannu, narrow-gauge railway to Mari Indus, broad-gauge with some changes to Lucknow, and by narrow-gauge again on the entrancingly sounding line, the Oudh and Tirhut, until eventually reached the frontier town of Raxaul.  Going through India both ways we suffered an unpleasant incident every day.\n\tWe had a night in the Legation Bungalow, then a 27-mile journey by the daily train of the Nepal Government Railway.  We travelled first class, the carriage painted red with black leather.  The second class coach was much gayer \u2013 a brown body, red steps, silver windows, green leather work and yellow lettering.  The journey took three house and we travelled in the company of the General Manager who \u2018showed us off\u2019 to the crowd at various stations on the way.  At the railhead we were introduced to the provincial Governor who lent us his car for the next stage of our journey \u2013 25 miles by road.  Our kit went by lorry with our two Gurkhas.\n\tNo sooner had we left the Governor his car had a puncture. Protocol did not allow us to transfer to the lorry and travel with our kit.  The puncture was mended and we continued, passing through the tunnel at Churia, to Bhimphedi where the road ended.  It was there that, in 1816, General Ochterlony\u2019s forces moved east into the Makwanpur valley at night, thus turning the right flank of the Gorkhalis\u2019 positions.  The Nepal Government, not wishing the British in Kathmandu, thereby asked for an armistice and the Treaty of Segowli, which remains in force to this day, resulted.  As we left having stopped to absorb this historic place one crone shrilled to an equally old gamma, \u2018I saw his face, I saw his face.\u2019\n\tDespite there being no roads from the flat Terai up over the high hills there were two methods of transporting items: one was by a \u2018rope-line\u2019 that hung from a two-way wire suspended from poles and the other for items too unwieldy or heavy to be carried on the \u2018rope-line\u2019 was by porters.  We came across a car being carried to Kathmandu.  There were two platforms, one for the engine and the other for the chassis, and ten men on each of the four protruding poles.  The tool box and the spare wheel had their individual carriers.\n\tIn contrast to the shrill indignities of the plains, life in Kathmandu was respectfully feudal.  Because they were so very seldom seen, Europeans were an object of curiosity, not scorn.  On the track three Tibetans, two men and a woman, came from the opposite direction.  The woman stared at me, her gaze untroubled byany notions of propriety or ancient ideas of decorum.  She crossed over to me and, not speaking, took my left wrist, pulled up the sleeve of my coat and pinched me hard.  On finding she had not met a bloodless ghost, she continued on her way.  I stared after her thoughtfully.\n\tUp in Kathmandu we lived in the house of the First Secretary, who arranged that we should visit the Royal Mint one afternoon.  We were met by the officer in charge, an elderly Nepalese Lieutenant Colonel.  My friend, being slightly senior, made the introductions.  We spoke English, as to speak Nepali was considered bad manners.  We were shown round and saw how coins were produced under primitive conditions.  It took over an hour.  We turned to thank the Colonel for the trouble he had taken.  His dismissal of my friend was perfunctory.  He came over and grasped my hand.\n\t\u2018I am so sorry to have to say good-bye to you.\u2019  I made some non-committal remark and he continued, \u2018It is not often we are privileged to meet someone like you here in Kathmandu.\u2019  He pumped my arm and continued to effuse, \u2018Oh what a pity we cannot have a Durbar so you could meet everybody and what a pity it is February so you cannot meet my wife.\u2019\n\tThe calendary implications were lost on me.  I wondered what the significance was.  His next remark was easier to follow.  \u2018Have you spare photo of yourself?\u2019\n\tI replied I had not and wondered what such attention meant.  Questions followed thick and fast: when was I returning to India? when was I returning to Nepal? why had I not given any prior warning of my arrival?  My arm was beginning to ache.\n\tThis excessive attention and lack of respect to his two month\u2019s seniority made my friend ask why the Colonel was asking all these questions.\n\t\u2018Because he is special man.\u2019\n\t\u2018What is special about him?\u2019\n\t\u2018He is first man winning Victoria Cross to visit Kathmandu,\u2019 explained the Colonel.\n\t\u2018No, no,\u2019 said my companion.  He has not won Victoria Cross.  His name is Lieutenant Cross.\u2019\n\tThe Colonel angrily looked at us in turn.  He muttered an expletive and threw away my hand as though he was touching some dreadful thing.  He turned round and walked quickly away, anger emanating from every line of his body.  My tiny moment of glory was over.  We both left on our week-long return journey shortly afterwards, keeping up the average incident rate.\n\tWe had an audience with the Maharaja.  The First Secretary took us.  Again protocol demanded English be used.  Unfortunately the Maharaja\u2019s English was worse than our Nepali and what made him more difficult to understand was a vocal tic that made even the two simple questions he asked us both \u2013 \u2018what is your name?\u2019 and \u2018where do you come from?\u2019 \u2013 so difficult to understand that I had to ask twice what the first question was and thrice the second.\n\tThe Maharaja turned to the two people, one on either side of him, and, still \u2018tic\u2019ing, said \u2018these people don\u2019t understand their own language.\u2019\n\tA previous Maharaj had been to India where he saw every lorry had \u2018Horn Please\u2019 and \u2018Thank you\u2019 painted on the tailboard.  Whenever anyone said \u2018Thank you\u2019 to him his invariable answer was \u2018Horn please\u2019.\nINDIA: 1947\n26***\nOn my way back to the battalion I had a day to spare in Lahore.  Wandering around the town I came across a shop selling carpets.  The shop was, strangely and for me a \u2018first\u2019, in that it was a Chinese one \u2013 something I had never expected in India \u2013 and there was a red-haired Englishman talking Chinese to the salesman.   I was utterly fascinated, imagining exotic \u2018thinks bubbles\u2019 over both heads as the two men chatted away.  How did the Englishman manage it?  Was his ability natural or induced?  Of course I had no means of finding out.\n\tTo say that watching a man buy a carpet is a life-changing moment seems a monstrous exaggeration, so maybe it is better to say that listening to him sowed a slow-growing seed that almost miraculously enhanced my life rather than changed it.  Remembering the struggles I had had trying to learn Roman Urdu on the troopship going out to India in 1944 and at the IMA three years before, such linguist skill was not for me.  Hadn\u2019t my Company 2ic said, \u2018Cadet Cross, if you join the Indian Army you\u2019ll be one that small band of officers whose men only follow you out of curiosity.\u2019  Those words rang in my head as I gaped at hearing the ease of those two men talking in the carpet shop.  I likewise?  No never.  The very idea boggled my mind.  But that fickle lady, Dame Fortune, had other ideas.  That was the spur that led me to speak nine Asian languages fluently and carry on simple conversations in three more.  A \u2018what if\u2019: had I not had a day to spare then, would my life not have been changed to the extent it eventually was, if at all?\n\tBoth journeys, to and fro, involved us in an unpleasant incident every day, except when we were on Nepalese soil.  Apart from being surrounded, spat at, threatened with knives and cudgels, abused, I ran out of money and ate one banana during the last forty-eight hours.  After listening to the red-haired European speaking Chinese I went back to the station.  Going  down a narrow lane in a tonga (a horse-drawn conveyance in which the passengers sit in the back) a crowd, shouting anti-British slogans, wormed its way towards us.  I cowered as low as I could, hoping that I would not be seen, but if I was I would be considered too insignificant to be dealt with.  Only as the mob passed me did they see one of the hated British and, as each one tried to turn round to wreak vengeance, he was pushed on by the ground-swell of movement behind him so never managed to do me a damage.  The few squawks of defiance were swallowed up in the general noise.  It was a frightening ride.\n\tLong before we got to the station, the tonga driver told me to get down.  I paid him off with the last of my money and, to my dismay, saw a huge crowed of women demonstrating in the middle of the large courtyard.  \u2018Out with the British, Pakistan for the Moslims, India for the Hindus, a graveyard for the Gurkhas, out with the British, kill them,\u2019 they were shouting.  The women\u2019s mouths opened and shut with as much grace as dying fishes.  I crept around the edge but was espied and a louder caterwauling ensued.  I managed to reach the portals of the entrance in safety, when I heard a growl of throaty Urdu from somewhere above me, telling me to go away.  I looked up and there was an enormous, cudgel-wielding Pathan blocking my path.  I made a lunge to the entrance and the women in the middle, witnessing my discomfort, screamed the louder in gleeful mockery.  I dashed, with the Pathan chasing me, on to the station platform.  I dodged around the crowd, espied the lavatory and stayed inside a cubicle, quaking for half an hour, until shortly before the train was due in.  And even then, on emerging, the attendant tried to get me to pay double price for having overstayed my welcome.\n27***\nDuring the spring of 1947 large masses of Pathans moved eastwards.   We saw them when we were picketing the hill tops.  There was no trouble but precautions were as stringent as ever.  Then, as suddenly, the mass movement ceased.  At the same time normal conditions so deteriorated until it took six weeks for urgent signals to reach Razmak from Delhi.  A messenger with a cleft stick would have been quicker.  Mail from home also took six weeks.  The local cinema showed the latest news reel, troops crossing the Rhine during the last winter of the war.\n\tIn mid-June we heard news of fighting in Kashmir, which explained the influx of men through our territory.  It was decided to have a \u2018flag march\u2019, comprising most of the Brigade Group, possibly three thousand men being involved.  Razmak was left in the hands of a rear party and the column reached Damdil, two days walk to the east.  On Sunday, 15th June, the battalion moved up a valley called the Mami Roga Algad.  High up on the hilltops pickets had to be established.  One, too weak by Frontier standards, had intermittent sniping from a position on a farther ridge.  Unbeknownst to the troops, a band of Pathans, in greater strength than they, were hiding in complete silence, some 20 yards from the picket.  Sometime after noon the sniping Pathans noticed the waving of red flags from the valley which heralded withdrawal.  Sniping became heavier and, at a prearranged signal, it stopped and those in hiding ran up the hill, overcame the Gurkhas and threw them downhill, snatching two rifles and a Bren gun.  One wounded man was left behind and was nobly rescued by Lieutenant Peter Davis who braved the Pathan covering fire which became more intense than ever.  Davis carried the man to safety and then dashed back to get his rifle.  He was nicked in the top of one finger and his almost total absence of injury was well-nigh miraculous.  Those of us whose duty lay elsewhere watched agonisingly as first we saw the Pathans, mere dots on the hilltop, close and grapple with the smaller dots, then as we tried to make out what was happening as the smaller dots, the soldiers, rolled downhill.  When Davis made his lone counter-attack, with D Company giving covering fire, excitement was intense.  Eyes strained through binoculars and the news was relayed to the short-sighted.  Punitive action was out of the question, as politically a clamp was put on all military activity and we returned prematurely to Razmak; a handful of Pathans bettering three thousand seasoned troops.  It was good to see Davis awarded the Military Cross in 1950, three years later.  It was the only case of a gallantry award being allowed without its own supporting campaign medal.\n\tA neighbouring Gurkha battalion, 1/4 Gurkha Rifles, had to evacuate its camp at Wana to go to Chaklala.  The few remaining Sikh workers of the Military Engineering Services had to be smuggled out of the camp in the same convoy as the soldiers.  Overt riding in trucks was impossible as the Sikhs and Pathans loathed each other with a deep and bitter loathing that invited trouble.  Unfortunately a Pathan naik, driver of one of the Royal India Army Service Corps (RIASC) lorries, had knowledge of this.  He must also have had liaison with the tribesmen.  The convoy, comprising two companies, was ambushed by what was reported as over a thousand Pathans.  The naik got out of his vehicle and showed the ambushers where the Sikhs were hidden.  They, and the three Gurkhas with them, were overpowered and shot in cold blood.  Although the naik was subsequently recognised, no action was taken.  That wonderful unit, the South Waziristan Scouts, came to the rescue and gave the Gurkhas sufficient breathing space to stop fighting, collect their baggage and find sanctuary in the local Scout fort.  There they stayed, cramped and uncomfortable, for two days.  A laksha, a holy war gathering of many Pathans, was waiting for their departure.  The last thing that Government wanted was a full-scale war.  Shortly before transport was due up to the fort to take the Gurkhas away, the Political Adviser, a dedicated and fluent Pushtu-speaking Briton, went to address the laksha.  He was witty and cracked jokes.  Men crowded around him.  He so dropped his voice that those on the edge could not hear.  \u2018Speak louder,\u2019 they cried.  \u2018The wind is taking my voice away, come down into the shelter of this valley,\u2019 was the answer.  They all agreed and skilfully and slowly the Political Adviser took them, including the sentries, out of sight and sound of the fort.\n\tThe transport arrived, tailboards down, drove into the courtyard without stopping.  As they drove in so bedding-rolls were thrown on board; as they drove out, the men themselves clambered on.  And as the vehicles departed a sentry noticed it and gave the alarm.  The Political Adviser was completely at their mercy but so successfully had he captivated their heats, the Pathans slapped their thighs and said, \u2018Wah, there goes a man.\u2019\n28***\nAbout this time a man of infinite patience but few resources wanted to chastise the cursed British.  He was the Faqir of Ipi, who had a band of ruffians, some camels and an artillery piece.  It was rumoured that none of his group knew the working of the sight, even if there was one.  The ingenious, though mostly inaccurate, method of laying it was to take out the breech-block, look through the barrel in the required direction, elevate it and, having replaced the breech-block, fire as long as he dared or as his ammunition lasted.  In Razmak there was a temptingly tall incinerator chimney which acted as an ideal aiming point.  It was known by the regular inhabitants as HMS Razmak.  As we British and Gurkha officers were having a group photograph taken, the Faqirstarted shelling the camp.  One shell landed not far away, between those being photographed and the Brigadier\u2019s house, another in the stacked-up mule fodder.  This started a fire that burnt until long after the belligerent Faqir and dismantled his gun and was away.  Indeed he was away before the spotter aircraft could bring back effective retaliatory fire in the suspected area of his operations.\n*\nOn 9th August the long-awaited details of our future were made known.  As the First Battalion of the First King George V\u2019s Own Gurkha Regiment (The Malau\u00f1 Regiment) we all thought we would be chosen for transfer to the British Army.  Not only were we not chosen as a regiment, but also the men had neither the right to opt for British Service, despite previous promises, nor allowed to go discharge with leave being indefinitely postponed.  Later we were told that the reason for choosing the four regiments that did join the British Army in Malaya was that three battalions, 1/6, 1/7 and 1/10 Gurkhas, were already in Burma, so that shipping costs would be lessened.  The remaining regiment, the 2nd Gurkha Rifles at Dehra Dun, had historical ties with the British Army, and were thus chosen.  But at the time none of the Gurkhas understood it, nor could we officers for that matter.  We were left without positive directions, we could therefore give none.  Pressure of events obscured the heartbreak.  Nor was there any properly planned hand-over to any incoming Indian officers.  They never came till after the bitter end, and the end was bitter.\n\tWithin a week of hearing this sad and sombre news of our departure, on the evening of 14th August, we gathered in Mess.  At the end of the meal, quietly but with an undercurrent of deep emotion, Mr. President arose at the end of the table and, tapping his request for silence,  said, \u2018Mr. Vice, for the last time, the King Emperor.\u2019\n\tMr. Vice stood up, gripped his glass, lifted it for the loyal toast.  \u2018Gentlemen, for the last time, the King Emperor.\u2019\n\tWe others rose and, lifting our glasses in our right hands, intoned the solemn refrain to the litany of lament, \u2018For the last time, the King Emperor.\u2019\n\tNext day, on 15th August, Independence Day was celebrated.  In Razmak a parade was held.  For the first time ever the Pakistani flag was unfurled over tribal territory.  The local Brigadier, the local Political Adviser and the Parade Commander gave three cheers.  The troops jubilantly responded.  After the parade had marched off, the Pakistani soldiers danced around and chanted, \u2018We are no longer slaves, we are no longer slaves.\u2019  Wherever an \u2018I\u2019 appeared in the soldiers\u2019 cloth shoulder-titles, it was inked in to make a \u2018P\u2019.\n\tLater that morning a church service was held.  As the minister prayed for the peace of the two new Dominions, the Pathans were sniping the camp from a neighbouring hill and the Rajputs, clad in dhotis, were pelting them with 3-inch mortar bombs.  It was a bad omen.  Later, during the brief sermon, it was quiet but even this was marred by a dog that had got in behind the piano, gone to sleep and was making rude noises.\n\tThe weather grew colder.  We were now in charge of Hindus in a religiously-motivated Muslim country, a country that had become an entity on this score.  There was nothing we could do except take all vigilant precautions when out of camp, on the range or opening the road.  The men looked to us for further guidance, and we could give them none.\n\tWe British officers were warned to return home.  I was having my tin trunk painted one Sunday morning and was just starting a letter home, \u2018Dear Parents, I should be home by Christmas...\u2019, when the bugle blew the Officers Call, at the double.  I put my pen down and ran to the Adjutant\u2019s office.  There news (having taken weeks to filter through from Delhi) greeted us.  We were \u2018frozen\u2019 and ten out of the fifteen of us were posted to 1/7 GR, to be part of the British Army, in Rangoon.  The remaining five were to go to the 7 GR Regimental Centre.  We would leave in December.  I went back to my room and dismissed the painter and then I remembered my letter.  I continued \u2018...but not this year.'\n\tThe Rajputs left soon after that, but we stayed on until early November.  As ever, prior to a move, more than one place had been announced.  Calcutta was the unit\u2019s destination but by the time the new frontier between Rawalpindi and Amritsar was crossed, somewhere in the state of Jammu, south of Kashmir, was to be our home.\n\tThe comparative seclusion of the Frontier had allowed us not to become involved in the horrible massacres which were sparked off by Partition.  Down in the Punjab, however, grim evidence of the unbelievable turmoil, the heartlessness and the senselessness of it all hit us hard.  Myriads of men, women and children, who were of the wrong faith in the wrong country, now with homes broken, impoverished and utterly without hope, made their forlorn journey from the Land of Penance to the Land of Promise.  Myriads never saw the planned end of their journey.  Thousands, each morning, would refuse to get up from the side of the road.  Death, that merciful releaser, would come soon enough without having the discomfort of looking for it.  It was a heart-breaking task for those involved.  We passed it by on the sidelines but even so were sickened with it.  On one road, 120 miles of bullock-carts were moving nose to tail, with death smelling sickly sweet the while.  We saw lorries mow down whole families and the drivers drive recklessly on.  When myriads die, what are a few more deaths?\n\tThe battalion moved up from Gurdaspur to somewhere along the River Ravi.  The only transport was one three-ton lorry abandoned by its rightful owners.  It was a time of unnatural stress for all.  Everything was of a hand-to-mouth nature, literally as regards feeding, metaphorically as regards the rest.  The politicians had set 31st December as our deadline to be out of the country.  I commanded C Company, which was stationed five miles over the Jammu border in a village called Kathuwa.  Prime Minister Attlee had forbidden British officers of India and Pakistan to go into Jammu or Kashmir because there was a danger of their fighting each other.  Even so I had to go to prepare what little I could for a new company commander when he came.  I trudged the dusty five miles morning and evening.  Folk had the jitters.  Around the temporary camp, latrines had to be dug and this was reported within twenty-four hours by Radio Pakistan as \u2018Indian troops digging defensive positions at Kathuwa\u2019.\n\tThe end was not far off.  Garbled orders and incomplete messages about us leaving and Indian officers taking over never properly made sense.  It seemed as though there was a conspiracy afoot to humble our departure even more than had appeared possible by not allowing us to hand over the soldiers to their new masters.  However grandiose the idea behind the act of pulling out, where men meant more than cyphers and numbers, it hurt.  Those who have never served in as tight-knit a community as a Gurkha battalion can have little idea of the wealth of camaraderie and the warmth of human relationships that exist.  But when the soldiers asked us the whys, whens, wheres and hows, we could only give general answers that had no bearing on our limited point of view.  Nothing really made sense, nor could anything satisfying and satisfactory be achieved.  It was a forlorn, heartless and painful experience.\n\tThe bloodshed and the hate engendered by the cataclysmically hurried rewriting of history could never be measured.  We living through it reckoned that three generations would be needed to heal the wounds of madness.  And then there would have to be no further exacerbating dissension meanwhile.  But within the battalion all was quiet.\n\tThus the end came.  I spent the last two nights in Jammu territory with my company.  There was no relief to hand over to and I hoped my talking with the men informally could tell them a little of what they wanted to know, without my being disloyal to my own side.  Imponderables abounded.  The company Second-in-Command, a Subedar, understood the difficulties.  Ours was a microscopic minuscule of the whole but we felt it none the less keenly for so being.  On parting, tears were shed and the sorrow was genuine and hard to bear.  My last view of my men (mine by proxy and mine no more) was moving out on foot and by camel on a patrol looking for Pakistani infiltrators.  I walked back over the border to India, indignant at the unseemly haste of having to meet an unrealistic political deadline.  I felt it a shocking and grievous way of settling affairs and my heart hung heavy.  We were abandoning our men, we had broken trust and, by God, it hurt.\n\tVillagers asked me why the British were leaving India.  My answer was that we had been told to go so going we were.  Many then said, \u2018don\u2019t go.  There will only be trouble if you go.\u2019  One strong rumour was that if India made a nonsense of independence, the British would be back in five years time!\n\tThe next day most of the officers left for Delhi and Madras, bound for Burma.  We had left Pakistan in November and now India in December.  In January of the new year we were due to leave Burma for Malaya.  And then, what?  One unseemly rush with chaos all around; was this really the only way we could settle our affairs?  As one senior Gurkha officer said, just before I left, \u2018Sahib, we have been serving together since 1815.  Could you not have waited one month longer?\u2019\n\tI am still ashamed the answer had to be \u2018no\u2019.\nMALAYA: 1947-1959\n29***\nThe one great and overriding difference between India and Malaya that struck us forcibly was placidity after paroxysms of chaos none of us had previously witnessed nor wanted to be part of ever again.  The greenness of the countryside and the tidiness of the towns were balm to our jaded spirits.  An absence of any obvious friction between the races we saw about us, Malay, Chinese, Ceylonese and Indians \u2013 mainly from the south \u2013 was a tonic as was seeing people going about with a sense of purpose and dignity of bearing.  As for the smallness of the place, why, within eighteen hours on a train we had traversed over half the length of the country!\n\tLater we came to understand the latent antipathy between the Malays \u2013 easy-going to some minds, indolent to others \u2013 and the Chinese \u2013 hard working and clannish.  One reason why the Malays were less animated than the Chinese could be that their diet was poorer and that they preferred a heavy meal at noon.  No one can work hard in a tropical climate with a full belly during the heat of the day.  A few condescendingly arrogant British said that \u2018they make good pets\u2019 and, as far as I could tell, all expatriates liked the Malays better than they did the Chinese.\n\tThe Malays\u2019 fear was that they would be outnumbered by the Chinese whom they saw as recent and non-Moslem interlopers.  Massaging statistics was not a \u2018forgotten sport\u2019 as one characteristic of the Malay temperament is \u2018wishful thinking\u2019.  An old Malay Hand, an Englishman who finished up as a District Superintendent of Royal Malaysia Police had this to say: \u2018their politeness which often turned into flattery and sycophancy was not normally dictated by hypocrisy so much as a genuine wish for all to be for the best in the best of all possible worlds.  They want to cut a good figure and this shows in their soldiers and police parade-ground smartness and the outward signs of efficiency.  Thereafter it is not difficult first to pretend to oneself that one is better, braver and more skilful than one in fact is and then to come to believe it.  Denigration of those who really did what one would have liked to have done is a necessary part of this self deception.\u2019\n\tThe Chinese know the Malays as \u2018crocodiles\u2019.  The Malays have their own derogatory name for the Chinese which is different from the name the Indians give them which sounds like the English \u2018So Can We\u2019.  This stems from two Chinese shops almost opposite each other near the Kuala Lumpur railway station pre-1939.  One was called Ooi Can Fook and the other Soe Can Wee \u2013 mystery solved.  One of the shops was bombed by the Japanese and the other either fell down or merely changed hands and name.\n30***\nIn 1948 when British Gurkhas started it was stated policy that it would be fully-officered by commissioned Gurkha by1975 but that never happened.  To decide how it would develop a delegation of interested staff officers was to fly up from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur to attend a special conference.  They were due to spend two nights in the HQ camp which which boasted two Messes, \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019.  My job was to receive them as they arrived on the scene and direct their baggage to whichever Mess they had been allocated.  Simple.  They were late and the first session of the conference had started by the time they arrived.\n\tI saw them get out of their coach, agitated and in a hurry.  \u2018Don\u2019t worry about your luggage,\u2019 I said to them.  \u2018I\u2019ll get it all sent up to the Messes and it\u2019ll be in your room when you get there.\u2019  I knew from a list that I had been given who was to be put where.  They seemed relieved to let me get on with that chore and save them a journey which would have made them later still.  They disappeared into the large Nissen hut that did for a conference hall.\n\tI looked at the baggage, checked my list of who was to go where and got it into two piles, one for \u2018A\u2019 Mess and the other for \u2018B\u2019 Mess.  A vehicle had been laid on and the kit was loaded up and safely delivered to the Mess staffs.  On the programme there was, so I had noticed, half an hour\u2019s mid-morning coffee break and, just in case I was wanted, I went back to the officers\u2019 arrival place.  This was where the main road split and two minor roads led uphill to each Mess.  Towards the end of the coffee break everything seemed quiet so I thought I could dismiss and take my fatigue party back to the unit lines.  As I was gathering my men together, I happened to look up and I saw one of the staff officers coming down the road with a suitcase.  He was red-faced and sweating.\n\t\u2018I thought you were going to get the kit into the right Mess for us,\u2019 he said querulously.\n\tI still had the list in my pocket.  \u2018May I know your name, sir?\u2019 I asked.\n\t\u2018Jones.  Major Jones.  I thought you knew.\u2019\n\tI ignored the unreasonableness of the remark and looked at the case he had put on the ground and I saw that Jones was the name on it.  There was only one Jones on the list.  I was on the point of mentioning that I could see no reason for his indignation, politely of course, when I saw another of the staff officers coming down the other road carrying a suitcase.  He, too, was red-faced and sweating and was also a major.\n\t\u2018I thought you were going to get the kit into the right Mess for us,\u2019 he said querulously.  I looked at his case and saw the name was Smith on it.\n\t\u2018Your name, sir?\u2019 I asked.\n\t\u2018Smith, Major Smith.  I thought you knew.\u2019  My military discipline kept me from making the reply I felt the situation deserved.  Also there was only one Smith on the list.\n\tMajors Jones and Smith then noticed the suitcase the other had carried down the hill.  \u2018That\u2019s mine,\u2019 they said in unison.  I was amazed to see Major Jones take the case with Smith written on it and Major Smith take the case with Jones written on it.  I could not believe my eyes.  What pantomime were they practising for?\n\tLuckily the vehicle that had come for us was commandeered for their suitcases and their owners to go back up the hill to \u2018A\u2019 Mess and back down and up to \u2018B\u2019 Mess.  When the vehicle came back the second time I simply had to find out where I had gone wrong.  Jones is Jones and Smith is Smith or so they had been up to then.\n\tI saluted as the officers got out of the vehicle to rejoin the conference that was on the point of restarting.  \u2018Excuse me, sir, but could you tell me where I went wrong in thinking that Jones was Jones and Smith was Smith and Smith is not Jones and Jones is not Smith?\u2019  It was all a bit of a mouthful but I managed it somehow.\n\tThey both looked embarrassed.  It appeared that both Smith and Jones had recently married and, one case in how many thousands? Major Smith\u2019s wife\u2019s maiden name was Jones and Major Jones\u2019 wife had been Smith.  How was I to know that each had taken his new wife\u2019s suitcase which still had her maiden name on when they came on the conference?\n31***\nFrom late 1949 to early 1951 I had the high-sounding title of Chief Instructor, Army School of Education (Gurkhas).  We were billeted in an old lunatic asylum near Tampoi Village, not far from Johore Bahru, just north of the causeway linking Malaya and Singapore.  The wits said that that was the only time they had heard of the inmates of such an establishment administering themselves.  The camp also included training facilities for jungle warfare and weapon training and was known as the FTC, short for FARELF, itself short for Far East Land Forces, Training Centre.\n\tAt about the same time embryo Gurkha sappers, Signallers and Military Policemen descended on us and had to be overlooked in their English work.\n\tThe first two OCs of ASE(G), now mercifully no longer with us, were cap-badged 7 GR.  Both were peace-loving people who, sensibly, preferred text books to tactics, grammars to grenades and reference books to rifles, realising that military value did not necessarily embrace military valour or virtue.  When, in 1948, future boss number 2 was recruiting in the western Indian depot, Lehra (enlistment in Nepal only started in 1959),  he enlisted a Darjeeling \u2018wide boy\u2019 \u2013 whose local history would have prevented him being enlisted in the eastern recruiting depot.  The Recruiter then came to command ASE(G) as Boss number 2, bringing with him the Darjeeling \u2018wide boy\u2019, by now a Sergeant.  Quick promotion, if you know other channels than that of normal command.  I found that besides being an ex-Indian Gorkha League man and a Communist to boot, his secret aim was to try and subvert all students to be anti-British and pro-Communist.\n\tHe asked for local leave and went to Bhutan Estate (near Seremban where there is a Gurkha labour force, brought over from the Darjeeling area in 1904.  There are two other estates in the area, Bute and Lothian, with a Gurkha labour force).  With him was a Gurkha officer, a potential instructor.  The aim of Sergeant\u2019s visit was to try and meet any Communist on the estate who could get him up to the Secretary General of the Malayan Communist Party, Chin Peng.  Although he failed to, that caused a violent quarrel between him and the Gurkha officer.  The Sergeant took his belt off and thrashed the officer who, shamed, asked to go back to his unit, 1/7 GR.  He asked to do an important camp recce after B Company located a large guerrilla camp.  He was allowed: he walked straight up to the camp and was shot dead, shame being the real killer.\n\tWith a certain amount of difficulty I managed to get rid of the \u2018wide-boy\u2019 instructor, who was clever: he could compose English sonnets, shame being the real killer. and his boss also felt it was time to go.\n\tThe third OC was a Royal Army Educational Corps (RAEC) officer who had served in 2/10 GR in Italy and, before joining up, was the reserve goal keeper for Liverpool football club.  He was a friendly enough soul who passed most of his days in an alcoholic daze and whose boss, a Brigadier in GHQ Singapore, fancied his wife as much as, if not more than, her legal owner.  That ended by the OC being posted to Penang.  I was blamed, rightly as it happened, and when the Brigadier was made a Major-General in charge of all army education in the War Office, he got his revenge by turning down my Singapore-published, later HMSO-produced, English for Gurkha Soldiers as not being professionally produced.  (I found it being used sixty years later in the hills.)\n\tThe fourth OC, also an RAEC officer, was a close relation of a legendary and ultra left wing Welsh socialist minister who had been with the Trade Unions Movement since a lad: he told me he wanted a new sort of roll call where the men would vote for what to do the following day.  I told him that the Brigade of Gurkhas had not reached the pinnacle of excellence by such methods and, grudgingly, he admitted \u2018perhaps they are not ready for it.\u2019\n\tDuring my early days we had an inspection by a group of earnest men from the heart of army education in Eltham Palace, London.  I was asked what teacher training I had done and received tut-tuttings of disbelief when I said none but any infantry officer worth his salt was always instructing his men so I felt there was no need for any.  Besides which, I added, I had started to read an educational pamphlet that on the first page asked the reader \u2018how long he had not thought of a steamroller for\u2019.  With such nonsense I was quite content to stay as I was.  The tut-tuttings were joined by frowns and shaken heads.  I did not let on that I had once got 0 percent for an essay at school and had also failed my School Certificate when I first sat it.\n\tWe were threatened with a visit from the CIGS, Chief of the Imperial General Staff.  Before he arrived during one English class, I told the students about the Head of the British Army, the CIGS.  \u2018Who knows what CIGS means?\u2019  I asked and had visions of a baton cross my eyes at the answer \u2018Chief Instructor, Gurkha School\u2019.\n\tAlthough I had never been an essay writer I had to teach students how to write the wretched things.  I said that their essays had to answer the questions why, where, who, how and what.  Blank stares greeted that sally.  Luckily we were on a verandah and a chicken was wandering around.  I told one man to catch it: he did.  I held it beak down on the table in front of the class, took a piece of chalk and drew a line from the end of the beak to about a foot away.  The chicken squinted at it and made no movement.  I gave that as an example of what to write about.  Only about half a minute later did I clap my hands loud enough to wake it from its trance.\n\tDuring my time at the School Britain recognised Red China.  \u2018Any questions?\u2019\n\tNo, but one Gurkhas said \u2018we did not know that Queen Victoria had promised the Chinese their inding-pinding.\u2019\n\tHowever, I want to leave such dull and trivial matters and turn to what happens when confronted with madmen.  The first, an ordinary student, was a rifleman from 2/10 GR, Chapalsing Rai.  In those early days of the Emergency we had to carry loaded weapons with us wherever we went, the guerrillas not yet having lost their zest for being pugnacious.  One evening I was called from my room by the Orderly Sergeant and asked to go to the canteen where Chapalsing was trying to balance beer bottles on glasses and not paying any attention to being told to desist.  I was intrigued so went.  \u2018Chapalsing,\u2019 I said, after temporarily dissuading him from not making any more mess, \u2018Let\u2019s go to your barrack.  It is time for bed.\u2019\n\tHe looked for his rifle, now in the Orderly Sergeant\u2019s hands, and away we went.  Once out in the open Chapalsing asked me to run away with him and hide.  I demurred, saying to leave it to the morrow.  Reluctantly he agreed and we got to his barrack room.  He sat down by his bed and tried to take his boots off without lifting his feet off the ground.  Eventually we got him under his net and I left.\n\tNext morning, early, I was sent for by my boss, the one who had enlisted the Gorkha League man.  \u2018Chapalsing has run away.  Go and look for him.\u2019\n\t\u2018Where are you going?\u2019\n\t\u2018Back to bed as I have a cold.\u2019\n\tI went to below the camp buildings to the open space that we used as a football ground.  From the far end a line of men were slowly beating up towards me.  In the foreground I saw Chapalsing lying on the grass.  He got up when I approached him.  Six yards away he came on the \u2018on guard\u2019 position, safety catch off, and told me that I would get shot if I came any nearer.\n\tOver his shoulder I saw the line of men, approaching stealthily and still out of eashot.\n\tI spoke with Chapalsing, to no effect until I used an English word.  I think it was \u2018boot\u2019 but I can\u2019t remember.  At that he lowered his rifle.  I took two paces towards him and one of the advancing men, by now in earshot, used an unpleasant word that Chapalsing heard.  He thought it was I who had spoken so this time I had his rifle two yards from my navel.\n\tI used another English word when talking to him and he lowered his rifle and, from behind, was overpowered.\n\tI looked round and saw the Majo looking at me from behind a bush.  I waved to him and shouted out that I thought he had gone to bed with a cold.  Rather shamefacedly he said it had got better before he had reached his room so he had come back.\n\tBefore we took Chapalsing to hospital the camp doctor decided to inject him with Pentothal.  He went back into childhood in what he told us: fascinating!  At the hospital he was found to have a tumour on his brain.  He was utterly shocked when I told him about the \u2018incident\u2019, nor would he believe me when I told him how he had threatened to kill me, twice.\n\tIt was during my visits to him that I was asked to see a 2/7 GR man who was of unsound mind.  I had to look at the name board above the beds to see which one he was in.  Next week he was in a different bed and the week after yet again in a different bed.  I had to look for him each time.\n\tAs I left the ward the third time a Tamil, a civilian from HM Dockyard, jumped out of his bed and came up to me and angrily accosted me.  \u2018You are the one who is mad.  You come from another ward, put on officer\u2019s clothes and look for the bed you feel you should be in.  We here are the sane ones,\u2019 and I managed to run away before he clobbered me.  I did not go back on any more visits.\n\tHowever, one night not so long afterwards, I was woken up by a Gurkha officer.  I found out later that he and a British corporal had beaten up the corporal\u2019s wife and a few others, got into a car and driven off.  The car with the corporal in it was on its side in a ditch at the bottom of the hill where our Mess was and the Gurkha officer came to me for help.\n\t\u2018What do you want, Sahib?\u2019 I asked.\n\t\u2018To go and see the ship\u2019s captain and for him to take me to see Pundit Nehru and then on to see Winston Churchill.\u2019\n\t\u2018Now?\u2019\n\t\u2018Yes,\u2019 and hinted it would be unwise of me not to help him.\n\t\u2018I\u2019ll help you.  Let me get dressed.\u2019\n\tMy own car was nearby and in we got.  \u2018Tell you what,\u2019 I said coaxingly, \u2018you won\u2019t be allowed on the boat if you have not been jabbed.  Let\u2019s do that before we go to the docks.\u2019\n\tHe agreed so I drove to the British Military Hospital and dumped him in casualty reception, gave an adequate reason and left to catch up on my sleep.\n\tThe medical Major in charge of him was an Irishman.  \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 he told me later, \u2018I thought he\u2019d go mad again and I wanted to see just by how much.\u2019\n\tAs I write this I ask myself how long can I not think of a mad Gurkha for?\n32***\nOne aspect not quickly resolved after the British returned to Malaya after their defeat in 1942 was tracing those missing in action.  I can still vividly see one incident in early 1949: our camp, which also included training facilities for jungle warfare and weapon training, had been a lunatic asylum before the war and the unkinder wits remarked that it was the only time they had known the inmates of such an institute administer themselves.\n\tAfter the Japanese had taken it over in 1942, they let most of the loonies out to fend for themselves.  Some were shot, others wandered away but most loitered around till they died.  Not only that, some wounded British troops being treated there were killed and their bodies buried in shallow pits without any mark.  The jungle was not far from our farthest building and in between was some open ground where we played football.  The area to be looked at was where we had seen some humps of earth just inside the edge of the jungle.\n\tA small team from the Graves Registration Unit, comprising British soldiers under a time-worn if not time-expired officer, came along to dig up old graves, or any suspicious mounds of earth, to see if any skulls or skeletons still with the owner\u2019s identity discs, could be found.  There was more than sentimentality in the gesture as such matters as life insurance and not knowing if one was no longer a wife but a widow needed to be resolved.  It was important for \u2018believed killed in action\u2019 to be confirmed as such.  After so many years in a tropical country, it seemed a hopeless task but, if that was what was wanted, so be it.\n\tOn the morning in question I was teaching practical map reading and so we were out of doors.  We were at the top end of the football pitch, the end nearest the class rooms but, naturally, we wandered as near as we could to where the soldiers were carefully scraping at those sad looking mounds of earth.  By that time we saw that they had dug up a number of skulls, six by one mound of earth, and a couple each in another three.\n\tWe watched as the oldest of the soldiers went over to the officer and, from his pocket, produced a flask \u2013 what of?  Rum?  Whisky?  Who knows but it was alcohol of some sort.\n\tThe officer still seemed hung over from the night before and, as he reached for the flask, we could see his hand shake.  As the soldier engaged him in conversation the other men quickly lit some cigarettes and put them all in the mouths of the skulls.  At a quick glance it looked as if the skulls had come alive and were smoking.  The soldiers moved smartly away out of sight.\n\tThe officer turned, suddenly saw the appalling sight of the skulls smoking and, to everybody\u2019s amazement, did not take it as a harmless practical joke but believed the evidence of his eyes.  He shrieked and fell into a dead faint.  For the few seconds he was unconscious the other soldiers returned and, in a flash, removed the cigarettes from the skulls\u2019 mouths.\n\tThe last we saw of the officer was being led away.  History never related what happened to him but, according to the Gurkhas, the two things that money cannot buy are parents and self-respect: the latter was blatantly obvious.\n33***\nOne ruler who did not want the British to leave Malaya was the Sultan of Johore.  He told the other rulers and politicians that the Malays would still be collecting coconuts had the British not come when they did.  However, he too had had his disagreements with the British: it was pre-war and a new hospital was to be opened by the Sultan in the Kluang district of the north of his state.  The young British District Officer had laid on lunch in his bungalow for the Sultan and Sultana before the ceremony.  He took them to the coolest room and offered the Sultana a long bamboo-slatted chair.  She sat down and, no longer being sylph-like, immediately went through it.  It was unfortunate that the broken pieces of bamboo acted as a fish trap to the extent that each time the exasperated lady tried to wriggle her way our she merely made matters worse \u2013 and more painful.\n\tEventually she was rescued: the Sultan was so angry that he ordered the District Officer out of his state within twenty-four hours, never to return and forbade him to go to the hospital for the opening ceremony.\n\tThe Englishman had the last word: \u2018Yes, Your Highness.\u2019\n\tAfter the war the erstwhile District Officer, now knighted, was Governor of Singapore, and the Sultan of Johore, who had made a trip to Britain sailed back so could only regain his state by going through Singapore, there being no international airport in Malaya.  He had to get the Governor\u2019s permission.  \u2018I still called him Your Highness but this time he had to call me Your Excellency,\u2019 the Great Man told me at a cocktail party the battalion threw for the Good and the Great of Hong Kong on our arrival in the colony.\n34***\nI scraped a car coming from the opposite direction while going over a bridge one night in Johore Bahru, Malaya.  I got out of my car and met three men, one plump Malay and two Europeans, in the middle of the bridge.\n\t\u2018You were driving far too fast,\u2019 the Malay accused me.\n\t\u2018Nonsense,\u2019 I answered rudely and rashly.\n\t\u2018You can\u2019t talk to me like that\u2019 \u2013 angrily.\n\t\u2018I see no reason why not\u2019 \u2013 haughtily.\n\t\u2018Because I\u2019m the Tenku Makhota, the Regent of Johore.\u2019\n\tOh folly of a disbelieving and quick answer.  As Tobias Smallett wrote in 1748 in The Adventures of Roderick Random: \u2018some are wise and some are otherwise\u2019.  \u2018In that case I\u2019m Julius Caesar,\u2019 and we solemnly shook hands.\n\tOne of the Europeans came over and earnestly confided that the Malay gentleman was who he said he was \u2013 and I wasn\u2019t.\n\tSo I turned to the Malay, still not really believing what I\u2019d heard and said, brashly, \u2018Reference my last transmission, for Julius Caesar read Captain J P Cross,\u2019 and we shook hands again.\n\tDamage was so slight we agreed we wouldn\u2019t report it and we resumed our journeys.  On advice from a friendly senior policemen who knew the gentleman concerned, and within the stipulated twenty-four-hour period, I went to the Police Station to report the incident.  I was given \u2018the book\u2019 where such incidents were recorded and I looked through the entries to see how they were made, never having had to do so previously.\n\tI read that a maniac had, around the same time as my incident, driven his car at a dangerous speed down the middle of the road and run full tilt into another car.  Mercifully no one was killed or injured: miraculously damage was minimal.  The report had been sent over the telephone and the address of sender was the Sultan's Palace.  Twice in one night?  No, only once: the registration of the dangerous car was S 2827 \u2013 mine.\n\tI never forgot the lesson I learnt that night!\n35***\nIt is true that only nature can improve on nature.  It\u2019s a break in the pattern that gives away secrets but, of course, you\u2019ve got to know the pattern before you can tell if it\u2019s been broken.\n\tIn the earliest days of the Malayan Emergency, some time in 1948, the good people of Sepang had been terrorised by a group of guerrillas who lived near the jungle edge at the back of the remoter squatter areas.  Their training included range practice and drill \u2013 they even blew bugle calls from time to time as the Japanese had taught them.  I took a platoon of 1/7 GR moved down to Sepang from Seremban.  Once there I was briefed by the local police and they were asked if they would go and investigate the situation.  Accordingly one morning, in the small hours at 2 o\u2019clock. I took a patrol into the area and worked our way behind the rubber estate labour lines before dawn.  It was slow going.  Between them and the jungle, five miles away, was a maze of tracks criss-crossing a multitude of small rubber holdings and tapioca patches, with scattered wooden huts dotted around.  The inhabitants were Chinese and each hut boasted a noisy dog or two.  My aim of the one-day patrol was an aggressive reconnaissance, ready to deal with any trouble should it be found.  It had to be back in Sepang by 3 o\u2019clock the same afternoon, so there was not a lot of time to do the job in hand.\n\tThe patrol\u2019s attention was first alerted at dawn by a bugle call, away in the west, in the direction of the jungle edge but as the soldiers were going that way in any case, it did not tell them anything new, only confirmed their suspicions and made them realise they had something positive to search for.  Three hours later we stopped and ate the meal we were carrying and then I decided to split my men up into two groups, both heading west.  Luckily we had two compasses.  One group had a man who could make piercing whistles and in my groups I could make cuckoo noises, so we could keep contact.  It was a better was of calling to each other than by shouting.  Radio?  You must be joking!  Anyway, we still still used the word \u2018wireless\u2019.\n\tAt noon, near the edge of the jungle, I was on the point of returning as nothing positive had been found, when we came across a hut, the first we had met for some time and seemingly deserted.  As a routine precaution while it was being investigated, the leading scout took up a fire position behind a tree and, as he knelt down, his foot hit a tin that was wrapped up in a sack.  This turned out to be a collection of Communist training pamphlets and other documents.  It was serious enough for us to join forces so I cuckooed loudly several times.  The rest of the patrol then joined up.  The house revealed nothing so we continued up the track that split soon after, one branch leading into the jungle and the other, which we followed, jinking up to a knoll overlooking the immediate area.  At the top was a hut.  Outside was an alarm system an alarm system of a can with a stone in it activated from a look-out in a nearby tree and inside a couple of sleeping platforms, some army blankets and a bugle \u2013 fashioned from burnt wood.  Clearly the guerrillas, for it could be no one else, had been surprised so suddenly that they had not even bothered to move the simmering kettle.  It was also obvious when the patrol commander went and had a look from their observation post that they had not seen the soldiers.\n\tSearching around for more clues, we heard, from the jungle that stretched away to the west below, a jungle bird call its mate, and, from a flank, the answer. \n\tAgain, a little later, the same call, farther away this time with the reply closer to it, as though converging on one another.  And then, after another pause, derisively, a third and very faint time.  It was the guerrillas who had left the observation position by separate routes joining up again.  We did not follow them up as we weren\u2019t geared for it and, anyway, it was late.  But they had to be guerrillas.  Why?  Because the call they happened to use at around noon and it was the sound of a type of nightjar that only calls at dawn and dusk, never heard calling during the day.\n\tWhat alerted them in the first place if they hadn\u2019t seen the patrol?  That, too, is quite simple.  You see, there are no cuckoos in Malaya and you can\u2019t improve on nature without some penalty, as both parties found out...\u2019\n36***\nDuring the war my parents decided to make a pair of gold cuff links for my elder brother who was killed before they were ready.  Accordingly it was decided that one link of each pair would have his initials engraved and, the other, with mine \u2013 a twenty-first birthday present.\n\tFour years later, on my first leave, I was given them with due solemnity and told not to lose them.  I went back to Malaya and, a year later, decided to buy a shirt that needed links, not buttons.  The first time I wore the links in the old lunatic asylum there was a power failure and I had to get undressed in the dark.  I took them out of the cuffs, carefully put them on the chest-of-drawers and wondered to myself \u2013 but why? \u2013 what I\u2019d do if, on the morrow, one was not there.  Telling myself not to be stupid, I got into bed, went to sleep and, next morning, one of the pair was not there.  I cursed myself for ever wondering that one might be missing.  I had the room completely searched and found nothing so, in case I was killed and my heavy kit went back home without them, I went to Singapore and had another made to match.  Now I had a pair.\n\tA year later I dared to wear them again.  By then I was in Singapore and I felt any Malayan jinx would have been left behind.  I took them off, in the light, put them on the top of the chest-of-drawers, turned the light out and, knowing they were safe and willing them to be there in the morning, got into bed...but next morning only one was there.  I had the room completely searched with no result.  I went back to the same Chinese goldsmith for a replica lest these links be missing from my heavy kit were the worst to happen to me.  I had another one made to have a pair.\n\tAnother year elapsed before I dared wear them again.  On taking off my shirt I hung it up, having felt and seen the two pairs of links still in the cuffs.  I got into bed, turned off the light and, some time later I got up in the dark and felt if both links were there.  Yes.  Third time lucky? I mused as I went to sleep.  But no.  Come the morning, one was missing.\n\tWhen I asked the goldsmith for yet another singleton he looked at me enquiringly but said nothing.  Had he been an Englishman rather than a Chinese I could have expected a crack about \u2018the missing link\u2019.  I vowed never to wear them again.\n\tA year or so later I went on home leave.  \u2018Shall I tell you something about those cuff links you gave me as a present?\u2019 I asked my mother, father having died by then.  \u2018What cuff links?\u2019 she answered, having forgotten all about them.\n\tOver seventy years later I still have them, still unused.\n37***\nTo be successful to counter Communist Revolutionary Warfare (CRW) in the jungle, the Western soldier must be fully trained in the three divergent characteristics of the enemy, the terrain and the climate.  There is always a load to be carried, a weapon ready to be fired and an enemy who might be quicker than you \u2013 \u2018there are only two sorts of gunmen - the quick and the dead,\u2019 as Grant Taylor, the scourge of Al Capone during Prohibition, had to tell us on a fleeting visit in 1947.  Jungle work is when high morale is of paramount importance.  I define this as \u2018giving of one\u2019s best when the spectators are of the fewest\u2019.  In other words, it is \u2018to go those last few yards\u2019 when the soldier finds himself tired, cold, hungry, afraid, outnumbered, frightened, lonely, perhaps wounded and far from base.\n\tThose whose task it was to operate in the jungle knew what being tired, wet through from sweat or rain, afraid, too hot or too cold, hungry and lost meant.  They knew what sweat and thirst, aching limbs, a heavy pack and chafing equipment, taut nerves and a fleeting enemy were.  They knew success sometimes, failure often, effort ever: as well as knowing intimately the all-pervading, close-horizoned, never-ending green of trees, bushes, shrubs, swamps, grasses, creepers and yet more trees which surrounded them as they made to dominate the jungle \u2013 a major tactic so often without any visible result.  In addition, leeches, mosquitoes, hairy caterpillars, ticks, wasps, hornets, along with the occasional scorpion and snake, all added to the hazards, if not the misery, which induced an enervating and a body-racking weariness.\n\tIf I may quote from a paper I wrote when commanding the JWS in December 1970, \u2018My final thoughts are that there is no front line, there is no fixed line of communication, no fixed direction of enemy approach, no set numbers.  The enemy has infinite patience, he moves quicker and better at night than we do, his camouflage is better, he is more ruthless and determined with his zealous belief, he eats and sleeps less and carries more than do we: there are millions of him.\u2019\n38***\nSome of us grew to love the jungle.  Spencer Chapman, the soldier who, almost single-handed, survived in the Malayan jungle all the time the Japanese were there, said that \u2018the jungle is neutral\u2019.  It is, but it is an armed neutrality.  It can never be taken for granted.  It has to be respected, as do mountains, which, like the jungle, \u2018make their own weather\u2019.  People whose first love is any particular terrain \u2013 jungle, desert, mountains or, I suppose, even the arctic wastes \u2013 are attracted to that sort of terrain for all their lives if their initiation is gentle and guided.\n\tIt took me a year properly to feel I could cope in the jungle.  Senses became razor sharp by day and by night.  After being shot at from four yards range and missed by a gap narrower than a whisker, a woman at home dreamt I was sitting on a high branch and in grave danger of falling off.  She shouted up to me to be careful and I answered cheekily.  The woman looked at the base of the tree and there stood my dead brother who told her not to worry as he was looking after me.  She was so struck she rang my mother the next morning and told her; and the timings between Malaya and England exactly coincided with my being shot at.\n39***\nSurrendered or captured guerrillas I had contact with were, almost to a man, delighted to get out of the jungle \u2018so stop being a communist and become a civilian again\u2019.  Their introduction to the jungle had been so different from that of the security forces that I do not blame them.  Life was not easy for us in the jungle but \u2018all was found\u2019: food and rations, equipment and ammunition were provided from the ground or were dropped from the air, casualties evacuated, to say nothing of support from helicopters, bombers or photo recce aircraft.  The guerrillas had to live off the land, on their wits and by courtesy of the local population without any \u2018mod mil coms\u2019.\n\tWhen those British pranksters got the better of their sodden officer, they could not have realised how those who do not believe in only One God to protect them from fiends and imps but take their spiritual nourishment from many minor deities, lived in respect of, if not in fear of, the Great Unknown at Local Level.\n\tLet me give examples which, doubtless to a sceptical person, are nonsense: twice when we killed a guerrilla in the late evening we could not dispose of the corpse there and then.  Special Branch\u2019s strict orders were that, if at all possible, the corpse should be evacuated so detectives could set to and recognise it properly.  Where that was impossible, finger prints were to be taken and a photograph of the face and only then were we allowed to bury it.\n\tThe corpse was put on one side of the camp for disposal on the morrow.  My batman, a fine shot, called Dharmajit Rai, felt ill as soon as it was dark.  His stomach started turning and twisting as though it had a nest of snakes in it.  His friends rallied round and took turns to sit on his stomach all night to quell the writhing.  It was the dead man\u2019s spirit and the lad only felt well after the corpse was disposed of.  That happened twice to this man.  One of my signallers would not sleep in the camp where the dead man was in case the corpse tried to take his clothes away.  As he was wearing them, the idea did not appeal.\n\tOn one occasion I was late in taking the photograph and the lids were stiff and cold over the eyes.  I therefore put my fingers on the lids, pulled them open and had the photograph taken with the eyes showing.  Result?  Special Branch accused me of torture as my fingers were clearly visible.\n*\nHow long does it take the spirit of the incorrectly buried not to cause living mortals stress?  Quite long, it would seem: one day a Gurkha signalman wanted to stretch his legs after a spell of duty in the signal communication centre, Comcen in the jargon.  He opened the door, strolled across the camp road to a patch of long grass, lalang, on the other side.  While there he decided to urinate.  When the jet hit the ground a searing hot pain entered him and he only just managed to stagger back to the Comcen.\n\tThe Sergeant in charge saw that something was badly wrong and ordered he be taken back to the barracks where he put to bed, unconscious.  The Gurkha Major was told about it.  He waited until the man awoke, went to see him and was amazed when the signalman only answered in Chinese, which he had never spoken before, nor did he understand any Nepali.  \u2018What to do, what not to do and how to do it?\u2019 were the vexed questions.\n\tThe first action to take was to find a Chinese shaman in the town and bring him up to the camp.  Having examined the man and spoken to him in Chinese, the shaman went to see where the unfortunate man had been savaged.  It was, as he had suspected, where the Japanese had massacred many Chinese who had been buried without the normal obsequies.  The hot jet had been the conduit for the still-to-be-sanctified spirits to get back into a living body.  The Chinese shaman did all the necessary obsequies to his dead countrymen\u2019s remains.  Thereafter the cure was simple: the Chinese shaman exorcised the signalman of the Chinese spirits and a Gurkha shaman made the body safe for the original innate spirits.  When these two acts of propitiation had been performed the signalman was back to normal, speaking Nepali again and not understanding one word of Chinese.\n\tThis was not a one-off incident: in early 1947 a young Gurkha rifleman of 1/4 GR, during a ten-minute break on the line of march on the North-West Frontier, urinated on a Muslim grave and was instantly \u2018possessed of an evil spirit\u2019, as the regimental history has it.  \u2018In fact, he became a raving lunatic and had to be disarmed and held down.  On getting him to the camp hospital the situation became worse when he was attended by a Muslim doctor.  A \u2018lama\u2019 was summoned and the man was cured by the administration of \u2018gold water\u2019 and the sacrifice of a chicken.\u2019  The history also records a similar case in the 1920s in the Hoshiarpur district of India.\n40***\nOn a patrol one day I was walking behind my ace Sergeant who suddenly bent down and put the back of his hand on some ashes.  They were warm.  As he looked around he saw a guerrilla hiding in the undergrowth.  We pulled him out.  He was wounded and maggots were eating the pus in his wounds.\n\tI bound him up and told the Sergeant to give him a drink of rum out of his bottle to cheer him up.  Thinking him not to know any English I said in rather stumbling Cantonese, \u2018don\u2019t be afraid, it is not poison.  Watch,\u2019 and told the Sergeant to take a swig out of the bottle.\n\tThis he did and handed the bottle to the guerrilla.\n\tThe Chinese took a swig, made a face and, in perfect English, asked \u2018is this Whisky, sir?\u2019\n\tHe was a one-time English schoolmaster.\n*\nCapturing guerrillas was not just a simple task of physically apprehending them, with or without a struggle.  They had to be \u2018processed\u2019 the whole time so that, legally, a charge of carrying a weapon, which carried the death sentence, could be made to stick in court.  If there was no proof of a soldier being detailed personally to carry the guerrilla's weapon, it could be argued in court that that weapon was not the one the guerrilla had been alleged to have been carrying so the charge was unproven.\n\tI was in court once as a witness that, in fact, the weapon the captured guerrilla had been carrying was the one he was accused of possessing.  At the end of the session the English judge put a black cap on his wig \u2013 an incongruity in that Malayan court room \u2013 and pronounced the sentence: \u2018You will be taken from here...\u2019 he paused, so did the interpreter.  The guerrilla looked up, a happy expression on his face, presuming he was being allowed to go free.  This was dashed into one of utter gloom as the full import of the next part of the verdict was translated to him: \u2018...to a place of lawful execution and there you will be hanged by the neck until you are dead.  And may the Lord have mercy on your soul!\u2019\n\tAfterwards, in the privacy of his rooms, wig and black hat lying beside on him on the table as he enjoyed a cup of tea, the judge said that he had a low opinion of army officers as they were not clever enough to be judges.\n\tAnd like the guerrilla a little earlier, I had no answer either.\n41***\nOne day in deep jungle I detailed a young soldier armed with a Sterling submachine gun, to be my gunman on a patrol.  The two of us set off from our overnight base and after a couple of hours started back on a different compass bearing.  We were not far from our base when my gunman stopped and looked at me in horror.  \u2018I\u2019ve dropped my magazine somewhere,\u2019 he stammered.\n\tInwardly I cursed.  It would mean careful looking for a small dark something in the jungle leaves, easily overlooked, but look we must.  How long will this take, I wondered and will those in the base camp worry at our late return.\n\tI then looked at the soldier and realised that...  I called him by his army number, the custom in Gurkha battalions, \u20186089.  Look under your right elbow\u2019 and there it was!\n\tThe relief that appeared on his face lives with me yet.\n42***\nThe area of operations lay in the northern part of Johore State.  The Forest Reserve held plentiful game, ranging from wild buffalo, tiger and bear to monkey and otter.  Mountain and valley were jungle-clad in profusion while stream and river were plentiful and limpid.  Nature was majestic and Official Man had kept away to the extent that the region had yet to be surveyed and the map sheet was white.  Unofficial Man, however, in the shape of guerrillas, had found uses for it.\n\tWe entered the jungle from a neighbouring oil-palm estate and started on an extensive patrolling programme which took us towards the higher ground.  Evening reports became monotonous in their negative repetition.  We took an airdrop of a further five days, ready to move even deeper than hitherto and well into the white map sheet.  Giving out details of my plan for this stage one of the corporals, Jasbahadur Rai, smiled a wicked little smile at me and said, \u2018We\u2019ll meet animals, nothing else!\u2019\n\tJasbahadur was a slight man, perennially cheerful, indefatigable, brave and a friend of some years standing.  I was stung by the implied rebuke of there being no real point in searching that part of the jungle so I said I would take my own patrol on the morrow and check for myself.\n\tI set off next morning with two men and an hour or so later happened on a log across a patch of swamp.  There, both on the wood and the soft ground, were footprints, heel and toe, starkly visible.  We followed the tracks heading in the general direction of the high hills before losing them.  We then returned.\n\tAll the other patrols had nothing to report, even Jasbahadur\u2019s.  When I told the other patrol leaders what I had found, polite scepticism greeted me, except in Jasbahadur\u2019s case.  \u2018Bears,\u2019 he said scornfully.  \u2018You never noticed the marks of the claws on the heels \u2013 nor, probably, did you examine the toes and see that they were all of equal length.\u2019\n\tHowever shaken I may have been inwardly at this forceful display of jungle lore, I resolutely stuck to my story.\n\tThe following day I moved the base to a point whence, were my diagnosis correct, we would have a fair chance of picking the tracks up again.  Once more I took two men, once more I found similar tracks which seemed to us more man-shaped than bear-shaped, and once more none of the rest found anything.\n\tThat evening Jasbahadur was more restrained than normal but not by much, correspondingly I may have shown a trace of satisfaction although I tried to hide it.\n\tBy then we were well within the confines of the near-useless map sheet and intuition played an even greater part than normal in our subsequent moves.  I felt convinced we were going to meet the tracks again and, sure enough, next morning, when we were moving as a company, we did.  The lead scout suddenly stopped, stared at the ground, made his mind up and signalled his discovery down the line of men to me.  I went forward and there, for all to see, were firm prints for two men, this time wearing shoes.  The tracks were not old and we had to press on but before we did that I sent down the column for Jasbahadur.  He came, grinning broadly and infectiously.  \u2018So you want to point out to me, saheb,\u2019 he said, \u2018that your bears are now wearing canvas shoes?\u2019  I gave him an apt answer and we continued on our way.\n\tThe following morning the patrol I went out with saw four pairs of trousers hanging out to dry.  As ill luck would have it, an Auster aircraft on a separate mission circled the spot once which meant, for the guerrillas, stand-to and be ready to leave at immediate notice.  I cursed my ill fortune: speed was obviously essential when stealth would be far more likely to bring results.\n\tTwo hours later we started to encircle the guerrilla camp.  Jasbahadur\u2019s group went round to the rear as cut-off troops and a third group moved to a flank.  The group that stayed with me was the assault group.  I had set the deadline for the assault as late as I possibly dared and, to make matters worse, no rain had fallen for some time and silent movement was only possible very, very slowly.  I waited for the third group to get into position but after the appointed time there was still no sign of them so, reluctantly and stupidly, I tried to hurry matters up.  This involved getting to the other side of the small stream that lay between us and the guerrilla camp and, hopefully in dead ground from any chance guerrilla sentry, to try and make visual contact with my third and overdue group.  Telling Ramansing, the nearest Bren gunner, to cover me but not to open fire until I signalled him, I crawled forward down the slope to the stream.  At the foot of the far bank I started to inch my way up the slope until I adjudged I had reached a spot whence I could attract the attention of the missing group, who should by then have been in sight.  They were not, so thinking my only chance of making any contact at all was to worm my way even nearer to the lip of the bank, I continued upwards.  My resolve was steeled by their non-appearance making success most unlikely and because we had already seen guerrilla movement and had realised that they were on the point of departure.\n\tSix yards from the top of the bank I craned my neck to try and spot the others.  I was unaware that I had been heard by one of the departing guerrillas who had turned back and was kneeling behind a tree, ready for me to show myself again.  My escort a little lower down did not see him either but Ramansing did.  He saw the sentry draw a bead of where I was about to emerge and, on tenterhooks, got ready to fire.  He saw the danger of my ignorance and realised that, for him to be first to open fire, he had to be very, very quick.\n\tStill in ignorance of what lay before me I crawled on up another two yards, craned my neck again; neither the guerrilla nor Ramansing could curb his impatience any longer.  At four yards\u2019 range the guerrilla opened fire on me, fractionally first and how he missed I\u2019ll never know but miss he did.  So did Ramansing.  I thought the guerrilla was hit as he disappeared up the hill but I could not be sure as I lay sweating under my own men\u2019s fire, head benumbed by the nearness of the shooting and seeing the bullets pepper the trees around me.\n\tI had to get up and get on so I yelled \u2018Cease fire!\u2019 at the top of my voice, several times, over the noise.  In the shattering silence I rose, staggered forward, my knees jelly.  I was unable to continue the chase.  Both the guerrilla and I had our lucky day.\n\tThat evening, in the bitter aftermath, I gave orders for the chase to continue on the morrow, after we had had a night\u2019s rest.  Jasbahadur still clung to his bear theory, much to Ramansing\u2019s annoyance.\n43***\nThere were five of us on patrol that day.  Already deep into the jungle we had been given further orders to extend our company boundary north to the Sungei Serting, a small but well-defined stream in the flat jungle to the north of Bahau, in Negri Sembilan, Malaya.  I had queried the order, not in any spirit of indiscipline, but because we were under command of another battalion and I wanted to make absolutely sure there were no snags; that, for instance, the rifle company to our north had been similarly warned and so had adjusted their own limits of permitted movement.\n\t\u2018All OK,\u2019 had been the laconic confirmation to my query.  \u2018Move north to the River Serting.  Troops to your north have been briefed accordingly.\u2019\n\tWe were expectant: empty camps for fifty and more had been found, heavily bunkered and difficult of approach.  One of the men had found an armourer\u2019s store, cleverly hidden near a stream.  Cultivations abounded in the general area and contact had been made with the guerrillas several times already.  It seemed to us that we were not far from their main body so we were tense as we moved out on patrol that overcast afternoon in May 1954.\n\tIt was a hot, muggy and oppressive day, with not a breath of wind.  Not having rained for some time it was noisy underfoot even for the normal slow and deliberate rate of advance for patrolling.  We therefore moved unusually slowly and deliberately northwards to the line of the River Serting.\n\tAbout an hour away from our overnight base camp and not far from the Serting I suddenly froze, standing stock still, signalling silence.  I had heard a noise off to our right that could have been man-made, like something striking a hard object.  After a short wait Jasbahadur smiled and muttered that it was a bird \u2013 who would make a noise like that in the jungle?  On we moved, I not convinced by Jasbahadur\u2019s reasoning.  A few minutes later I heard it again \u2013 nearer and louder, a cracking noise, almost a report, over to our right.\n\tAgain we listened - again we waited and again Jasbahadur broke the tension by smiling and muttering, \u2018This time it was the branch of a tree,\u2019 but none of us was convinced.  I wanted to investigate farther so ordered a change of direction, over to the east.\n\tAlongside the slight rise in the ground on which we were when the suspicious noises had been heard was a swamp, filled with a type of aloe, those giant, serrated, thick fronds that crackle when rubbed against and which catch on skin, clothing and equipment alike.  They are hateful and extremely nasty things through which to have to move, needing to be treated with the greatest respect.\n\tAs carefully, slowly and quietly as possible, we started to cross the swamp.  Our feet oozed filth, our clothing was blackened with sweat in the oppressive dampness and our senses cursed the fevered orchestra of a myriad insects, plangent and strident in their whining, croaking and aimlessly repetitive cacophony.\n\tWe were halfway across when we heard the unmistakable clink of metal against metal, followed by a low buzz of indistinguishable but Chinese-sounding conversation.  So men it was after all!  I caught Jasbahadur\u2019s eye and looked at him haughtily.  A rapid appraisal was required...were they coming our way?...could we reach them undetected?...how many were they?  They started moving towards us.\n\tWe had been in single file and thus we stayed, frozen in our tracks, weapons at the ready; then we slowly turned towards the noise of men who were approaching us at an oblique angle across our front.  Then suddenly, there they were, passing us within yards, unaware of us \u2013 one, two, three...seven in all.\n\t\u2018Fire only when I order,\u2019 I whispered \u2013 tense and expectant.  It was Jasbahadur on my right who hissed at me, \u2018Don't fire!\u2019  It was not the reaction that I expected although, curiously enough, they seemed to be wearing clothes of a pattern darker than \u2018guerrilla khaki\u2019 but then it was well known the Communists had recently got through Security Force positions using captured uniforms and thus clad had successfully ambushed unsuspecting soldiers...  Then, as one man, those seven turned towards us and saw five men, in standing fire positions, covering them.  As they turned I saw all had red Communist-type stars in their hats.  Instantaneously and instinctively they levelled their weapons at us, utterly taken by surprise by our presence.\n\tI was in an agony of suspense - were they Chinese or Gurkha?  It had become too dark to see clearly.  v\n\t\u2018Don't shoot!  Don\u2019t shoot!\u2019 I cried in Gurkhali...and they didn\u2019t.\n\tI later realised my reasoning to be \u2018if I speak in Chinese and they are Gurkhas, shoot they will and miss they won\u2019t: if I speak in Gurkhali and they are Chinese, shoot they will and miss they might...the latter is the safer\u2019, but at the time it was animal survival at work.  Gurkhas they were and lower their weapons they did.\n\tWe were all badly shaken and, atypically, mutual recrimination set in.  We both accused the others of poaching.  It transpired that our clearance had not been notified to them.  Their red star was an anti-Chinese ruse, worn only in the jungle, never in the lines.  The Chinese-sounding speech happened to be that of a Gurkha Sergeant, nicknamed, I later learnt, \u2018Cheena\u2019.  The noises I had heard were made by the patrol finding and piercing tins of rice that the guerrillas had hidden, thus allowing water to seep into them, spoil the contents and so deny them to the enemy.\n\tWe decided to part, moving back to our original areas.  Our relief at not shooting each other was only tempered by disappointment at being robbed of a contact.  Unhappy thoughts chased each other through my mind as we went back to our base camp.  That evening, after an acrimonious session on \u2018the blower\u2019, I called Jasbahadur over to me.\n\t\u2018Why did you tell me not to open fire?\u2019 I queried.  He looked up at me and answered simply.  \u2018Because I recognised my brother.\u2019\n44***\nSo much of our work in the jungle, especially in the middle fifties, was repetitive, monotonous and unproductive.  One statistic gleaned from some arcane source revealed that the average rifle company needed a million man hours to achieve one kill or capture of a guerrilla during the years 1953 to 1956.  Certainly, contacts were usually so fleeting that time actually spent in combat could be measured in seconds rather than minutes.\n\tDuring this period it was hard to acquire up-to-date evidence, collateral or otherwise, of the \u2018baddies\u2019 and their intentions so any documentary evidence available was, by definition and of necessity, grist to our mill.\n\tOne morning, having received five days\u2019 rations the previous day, we set off on yet another leg of our prophylactic and so-far-unrewarded patrolling.  That evening we camped near a large stream.  There was no evidence of guerrilla movement and the area seemed dead.\n\tThe next morning two of us awoke with a gut ache, myself and a young soldier named Dharmajit so, instead of making the planned early start, I decided to wait until after the morning meal before making any decision to move.  In the meantime I ordered perimeter guards to be doubled and placed irregularly.  No sooner had all this been done when firing broke out as two guerrillas walked to the far bank of the stream.  Vision was obscured by cordite smoke mixing with the mist over the water and only one of the pair was killed.  Both packs were picked up.  They were stuffed full of documents.\n\tI contacted HQ, photographed, finger-printed and buried the dead man and then inspected the contents of the two packs.  Around me I heard the last round of congratulations and recriminations finally peter out.  I found most of the documents were standard Communist propaganda tracts with, in English and Chinese, such titles as \u2018Freedom News\u2019 and \u2018Red Star\u2019.  These seemed uninteresting but there were some exciting-looking letters, wrapped up into cone-shaped spills.  The former were bulky and, I felt, not really worth taking back, despite stringent orders that everything was required.  We moved off slowly as we still had four days\u2019 rations with us and Dharmajit was ill.\n\tThat evening we were still two days\u2019 march from another dropping zone and I was ordered to be there by noon of the second day, take my resupply there and be ready to receive a helicopter which was coming to take the documents away.  By getting there by noon, I could secure the area for the helicopter to land safely.  I said it could also take Dharmajit away.  I made my plans to arrive there at 11 o\u2019clock which would give me ample time to do all that had to be done.  Imagine my horror when I heard the helicopter coming while I was still half an hour or so from the landing site.  I threw caution to the winds; we put our heads down and went like the clappers.  Helicopters were very scarce then and to have missed it would have entailed greater inconveniences.\n\tIt was uncomfortable while it lasted.  Navigation was no problem as we made for the direction that the helicopter was circling.  Other than that the undergrowth and thorns tore us and our clothing as we pushed through, while the carriage of weapons, packs, something taken as normal, became burdensome, especially for the men carrying those wretched tracts.\n\tWe just got to the site in time as the pilot, apparently, only had five minutes\u2019 fuel spare before he would have to return.  He had put his machine down as soon as the fastest movers had come into view.  He was now out of his machine and was disconsolately looking around as I came up, breathless, thorn-torn and sweating.  He commiserated and said he understood.  Dharmajit arrived half an hour later, looking ghastly.  Soon after both he and the documents were loaded and the aircraft flew away.\n\tAs we were all tired and because a river flowed temptingly nearby, I declared a holiday and we bathed and laundered our clothes.  Next day we took our airdrop and were ordered to walk out to the road, twenty map-miles away, during the next five days, patrolling as we went.\n\tMeanwhile the documents had been sent to Special Branch in Segamat, North Johore, where the exciting-looking spills turned out to the less than exciting, a bitter blow, and, as expected, the propaganda tracts were valueless.\n\tWe continued patrolling to the jungle edge without incident and returned to our company base.  I reported to the CO the next day who, surprisingly, thanked me from Special Branch for bringing out those bulky tracts.  It transpired that Special Branch, Johore, the next senior to that in Segamat, had, at the last moment, asked for them.  Their best man had cursorily glanced through them.  At first he too had wondered why I had bothered to report their discovery but then a worm of suspicion had entered his mind and he had examined them with greater care and growing excitement.\n\tTwo days later he had managed to break the code the tracts concealed and found they revealed the latest Politburo directive for infiltrating schools, trade unions and local government.  By prompt action, taken in forestalling these planned developments, much trouble was avoided in Malaya where it was reckoned that Authority had learnt about the new directive maybe a year before otherwise might have been the case.  Singapore, also a target, disregarded the evidence and suffered from student anarchy.\n\tThe code was that only every fourth word was used to spell out the orders of the Politburo, while the whole text very cleverly managed to obfuscate the real message by making sense in its own right.\n\tI realised neither I, nor anyone else for that matter, would ever have known about any of this had I thrown the tracts away but, even so, I shuddered at the thought of what might have been the results of my initial impetuosity \u2013 and had I not had gut ache!\nANIMALS, BIRDS AND INSECTS\n45***\nAnimals sometimes meant that a patrol\u2019s position was given away.  One example was when the leading scout on one patrol I was on, staring intently to his front, did not notice a pig wallowing in some mud.  The pig did not notice anyone approaching it and when the scout trod on it it reared up with a terrified scream and knocked the scout backwards, falling heavily.  The pig\u2019s scream and noisy escape made such a racket that anyone quite a distance away would have heard it.\n*\nA patrol of 2/7 GR found a baby elephant stuck in a hole.  They rescued it and, it being a hot day, one or two men took out their water bottles for a drink.  The elephant tried to drink the water as it came out of the bottles so a poncho cape was opened and all the patrols\u2019 water was poured into it so the baby elephant could quench its thirst.  After that the animal followed the patrol wherever it went, making such a noise it was worthless staying in the jungle so they returned to base.  The elephant, being the property of the sultan of the state they were operating in, had to be handed over.\n*\nI once spoke to a real tigress in the London zoo and she responded.  The onlookers thought I was talking tiger language and were vastly impressed.  I kidded them into believing it had taken me five years to learn.  In fact the tigress was the cub a patrol of 1/7 GR in Malaya had picked up after the mother had been frightened away.  The cub was kept in the battalion lines for six months when it was deemed too big to continue following its handler by day and sleeping under the handler\u2019s bed by night.  She was sent to the zoo and the handler, piqued at no longer being the owner of a tigress, decided to go on discharge.\n\tAnother true tiger story was told me by a friend of mine, a Scottish missionary: he went to Lucknow zoo with some of the pupils of the school where he was teaching.  He was invited over the barrier of a tiger\u2019s cage by the keeper.  After much hesitation over he stepped.  \u2018Put your hand through the bars and stroke the tiger behind its ear,\u2019 said the keeper.  After much hesitation this he did and, to his surprise, the tiger loved it, purring loudly.  After a couple of minutes my friend withdrew his hand and the keeper told him that the tiger had been a pet of Pundit Nehru and had only been sent to the zoo when it got too big.  An Indian in the crowd that had gathered, so he said later, \u2018What that white man can do, so can I,\u2019 and a couple of days later he went to the same cage and did the same thing, only to have his arm bitten off.  The keeper had switched animals.\n*\nOne day Buddhiman and I reached the local golf course before dawn and I left Buddhiman sitting in his car, walked away into a jungly patch.  A couple of minutes later a leopard walked in front of Buddhiman\u2019s car having come from my direction.  I only knew about it when I got home: I\u2019d have known about it earlier if it had been hungry. \n\tBut a hungry leopard was seen stalking a bull close to a group of small boys when they were walking up to a Buddhist shrine.  It sprang on the bull that butted it off, bellowing, only to be sprung on a second time.  It butted the leopard off again but the third time the leopard felled it, took an enormous chunk of flesh out of the bull's neck.  The two animals made a lot of noise between them before the leopard loped off.  One boy was full of it on his return.  'Were you afraid?' I asked one of them.  'Yes, until I saw I was not the target,' was his answer.\nCatapults are carried by all small boys up in the mountain villages.  One lad, not yet ten was by himself in the forest tending goats when, from only four feet away, he suddenly saw a leopard slinking after the nearest goat.  The lad instantly took his catapult that was hanging around his neck, picked up a stone just as fast as he could and \u2018shot\u2019 the beast as it jumped at him, scratching his scalp as it fled away.  The lad did not return home till it was time, then calmly told his parents about it!  Big cats and jackals eat corn cobs if there is no meat available.\n\tWhen Buddhiman's second sister was pregnant, she shared in a communal feast that included leopard meat which is known to be efficacious against all known stomach problems.  Her baby son was a very loud snorer from birth.  When I suggested that a tonsil and adenoids aberration might be the answer I was told, politely but firmly, no, that would not help as his mother had eaten leopard meat when he was still unborn and there was, therefore, no point in looking for any remedy as it was the leopard's influence at work.\nLeopards jumped over the barbed wire fence on our \u2018compound\u2019s\u2019 wall a few times and took away one our small dogs each time and, later, two geese.  The second little dog, closer to me than my shadow, yelped when killed at around half past 9.  One of the boys ran out and the leopard ran off.  The corpse was put in the garage prior to being buried the next day but the leopard returned during the night and took it off.  Since then we have only kept big dogs.\n*\nThe cure for foot-and-mouth disease is molasses and crocodiles' urine mixed up to use as a poultice.  Crocodiles' urine is sold quite cheaply in bottles from the zoo in Kathmandu.  However difficult it may be to get said substance, it is easier than the answer to the problem of how a gambler need never lose when he \u2018plays for money\u2019.  He has to find two substances.  One is the afterbirth of a black cat born on Tuesday and the other a small bird already caught in a spider's web, also on a Tuesday.\n*\nBuddhiman and I witnessed a sad and unusual sight one morning.  Three mules were trying to bite a month-old colt to death.  The colt's mother and two other horses were unable to stop them.  Buddhiman ran over and joined in the few men who had come to sort the matter out.  They managed to drive the mules away after much running around and stress.  They colt had been bitten all over body and face but not in the eyes.\n \tSince then we have learnt that mules always attack colts, trying to kill them and sometimes succeeding.  A friend of mine sent me a pictured e-mail showing a mule killing a small lion in Montana.\n*\nBuddhiman's younger brother kept pigs.  One day he killed one and his family had pig meat for their evening meal.  The next day his youngest daughter complained that she could see nothing.  She had to be led.  Father wondered why.  Pig meat?  He vowed never to eat pig meat again, killed his remaining animals, held a puja and pasted new mud on the floors where it should be pasted.  Next morning youngest daughter saw as plainly as she ever had.  Coincidence?\n*\nDuring one religious ceremony I was at the priest sat on a throne, intoning the scriptures.  A band that had two types of drums, percussion instruments, harmonium and flute, along with repetitive singing, played and people came into the centre and danced, whirling and twirling, arms raised, hands flapping and faces with far-away looks.  But for the first time anyone could recollect, each time the music started a young cow, not owned by anyone, came into the arena.  It was fed with bananas before being shooed away.  No one knew why a sacred animal would enhance such an occasion.  However, I remembered when my young brother had many cows to milk twice a day, managing to increase their yield by playing taped music to help them on.  The good folk here could happily put the appearance of the sacred cow to divine inspiration but there could well have been a secular reason for its appearance.\n*\nWhen Buddhiman and I were in England settling affairs after my mother\u2019s death, back in Nepal, Bhimkumari, Buddhiman\u2019s wife, was \u2018expecting\u2019.  I was driving the car four magpies flew across our front.  I told Buddhiman the nursery rhyme \u2018One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a daughter and four for a boy.\u2019  Back in our Nepali home Buddhiman\u2019s mother had come down from the village to help her daughter-in-law.  Sitting outside she heard some crows, which never came to the house, crowing.  \u2018Listen,\u2019 she said, cocking her ears.  Apparently if a boy was to be born a crow would \u2018caw-caw-caw-caw\u2019 and if a girl \u2018caw-cakra-caw-cakra \u2018would be heard.  \u2018Your baby will be a boy\u2019 she said and it was, born the next day, the day those four magpies flew in front of us.\nDuring the birth the hospital lights were cut off at the mains and the reserve plant also f ailed halfway.  So badly was Bhimkumari stitched up she had to return for re-stitching four days later when the lights again failed.  An Indian Army dentist, a part-time astrologer prophesied difficulties when he had looked at her hand about fifteen years previously.\n*\nOne of our two geese laid six eggs and left two unhatched after four ducklings had emerged.  Bhimkumari\u2019s youngest brother, Himan, lifted one of the unhatched eggs and felt a scrabbling within.  He put it under one of those \u2018old-fashioned\u2019 light bulbs for two hours and out came a duckling.  To Himan\u2019s surprise it started following him and when he put it with the other four, it still seemed to prefer Himan to his mother.\n*\nOne evening during the monsoon, to get some coolth, Buddhiman and I went up onto the flat part of our roof.  Twenty yards or so to the south is a row of tall trees with some owls\u2019 nests in them.  I was facing north and was suddenly hit sharply on the back of my bald pate, knocking it forward.  It was an owl attacking me, presumably thinking that that shining thing was an enemy.  I have been urinated on b a vulture and defecated on by a monkey \u2013 both firsts \u2013 and this was the third first, something that cannot have happened to many others.  A unique treble!\n*\nVultures have bare necks so that they can withdraw their heads from the inside a dead or dying animal\u2019s anus without difficulty.  I have only seen this with cows.  Most strangely, if the corpse is lying directly on a north-south axis, no vulture will go near it.  No one I have asked has been able to give me a reason why.\n\tAnd, more easily understood, several times aircraft from Kathmandu to Pokhara have had to return because of vultures flying incircles over the aerodrome.\n*\nThe first camp I did my recruiting in Nepal, athwart the Indian border, had an old Hindu temple in it.  At the start of the cold weather demoiselle cranes would fly south to the warmer places and at the end when it became too hot south, return north.  Both times they flew round and round the temple before moving off on a different bearing.\n*\nInsects can be deadly: a man in our mountain village was stung to death by hornets, the deadly black-with-a-yellow-band variety.  So thick were the stings left in his arms and legs there was no room for a pain-killing needle to be inserted.  It took him about six hours to die.  One way to defeat these creatures, but only if they are few, is to remain stock-still in whatever position they are in at the time.  If hornets chase anyone who is lucky enough both to have a river nearby and a branch of foliage in his hand, jump into the river, stay below for as long as possible, letting the foliage drift downstream.  The hornets will stay with foliage, trying to sting it to death.  Even being under water will not save a person from hornets' stings as they go under water.\n\tA hornet stung me three times, once on the hand and twice when the brute crawled up the inside of my shorts.  I am only so thankful that it took an outside route, rather than an inside one as I shudder to think what would have happened.  It took a week to get back to (what passes for) normal as a lethargy of will power took over for that length of time.\n\tI kept well away from a nest of wild bees I could see when on my morning walks.  Two small boys disturbed and four goats, two cows, one buffalo and one adult were stung to death.  Police took the small boys away but I do not know what happened to them.\nMALAY-THAI BORDER: 1961-1963\n46***\nThe axis of movement for the guerrillas based in the Betong Salient in the farthest south of Thailand to the most powerful aborigine in north Malaya was discovered by my D Company, 1/7 GR, moving up to the Thai border.  We boated up a large river, the Sungei Perak, for two days then walked.  The next morning we had a wonderful view of a dozen or so monkeys crossing the river by using the current round a bend, clutching on to the tail of the monkey in front.  We came across traces of otters, elephants, porcupines and a bear.  Wild life was more prolific and less disturbed than farther south as that particular area had never been bombed.  Bird life abounded as did wild fruit trees; prickly breadfruit, sweet bananas, smelly durians, delicious mangosteens and some nameless nuts.\n\tOn our way towards the Thai border we found fresh footprints for four or five guerrillas, unhappily soon lost, and a temporary sleeping platform by a small stream.  I thought that this movement was nothing more than routine guerrilla patrolling south from Thailand.  It was two days after the last find of any guerrilla evidence that a patrol\u2019s attention was attracted to three limes that were lying under a tree, which was not a lime tree.  My men thought they were about three months old.  Half an hour later we came across three more limes, fresh this time, under another tree, not a lime tree.  Could they have been put there by the guerrillas whose footprints were had discovered?\n\tI sent a radio message to Battalion HQ asking a very surprised Intelligence Officer to find out where any lime grove was in north Malays.  Two weeks later, back in base, I learnt that the Forestry Office and Special Branch had got together and established that there were probably none to the west of the main mountain ridge that divides the country.  So, the likelihood was that those limes had come from the area of the most powerful aborigine headman, Bongsoo Helwood, to the east of the main range and were being used as a code telling others who knew it when a party of guerrillas had used that route.  The age of the first lot of limes and the three-monthly visits fitted into the theory without forcing it.  And that is how the axis of movement was discovered for the first time ever, thanks to an observant Gurkha leading scout.\nThat put the following into my mind:\n  And should you ask, where do they live,\n  These men with skill superlative\n  Who showed superb initiative\n  Enhanced their name, achieved success\n  And gave the bandits no redress?\n  The jungle is their home address.\n47***\nFinding the limes led me and my A Company on three unusually strenuous journeys with the Temiar who lived remotely in the Malayan jungle.  We used to such people as Sakai until we were told it meant slave, so was a dirty word.  In Sabah Sakai means \u2018stranger\u2019 and in Japan \u2018guest\u2019.  We were told to call them \u2018aborigines\u2019 and that soon became \u2018abos\u2019, then that word had to disappear.  Women aren\u2019t the only ones plagued by fashion...\n\tDuring the early 1950s efforts had been made to wean them from living a nomadic life in deep jungle where the main group, Temiar, was being used as a screen for guerrilla movement; so they were herded out from the high forests and brought down into resettlement camps in the open plains where far too many of them died.  The rest were let out after that and hardly a soul was seen for maybe five years, so afraid were they of another dose of Government medicine.  The Communists made great capital out of the \u2018oppressors\u2019 and their methods and this made the Temiar more than ever determined not to become involved with \u2018Government\u2019 again.  Interestingly enough, the \u2018hill tribesmen\u2019 of Thailand and Laos, as well as the \u2018Montagnards\u2019 of central Vietnam, all had the same mistakes made against them, apparently, by everyone except the Chinese who tried to organise them\n\tBy the time of the early 1960s more efforts had to be made to wean the aborigines from the Chinese guerrillas.  This was not as easy as it sounded as the \u2018Emergency\u2019 in Malaya was over.  The Special Branch staff overseeing them was based on the small town small town, Grik, on the southwestern fringe of Temiar territory.  It was about then that Chin Peng, the guerrillas\u2019 veteran leader, ordered his three lieutenants to step up their campaign of pro-Communist influence among the aborigines so this meant that Ah Soo Chai, who had a sore leg and couldn\u2019t squat naturally on his hunkers, Tek Miau and Lo See went stomping the ulu, as the hinterland jungle was known.  For twenty years it had been a game of hide-and-seek which involved many Temiar settlements, known as \u2018ladangs\u2019, being visited by both sides, our men always arriving too late to be effective.  However, Security Forces were, to an extent, able to curtail guerrilla movement.\n\tOne particular settlement was suspect, that which belonged to a certain Kerinching who had been a guerrilla supporter but had recently recanted such loyalty.  He lived on the banks of the River Temenggor.  Special Branch had only just let any military unit into the area where Kerinching held considerable sway and they were instructed not to go into his house unless invited.  The Gurkhas made camp close to and he would come and watch them with grave suspicion.  There was a Chinese Civilian Liaison Officer with the platoon, one Goh Ah Hok, who had the rare distinction of being twice decorated for brave work.  Goh and Kerinching got friendly and one evening Kerinching came to the platoon camp and mentioned to Goh that one of the inmates had just died and so the whole of the settlement would have to be burnt according to custom.  To save him trouble would the soldiers go and start the blaze for him?  So the platoon commander said they would.  They went inside Kerinching\u2019s house to check that there was no movable property left.  There, besides the rudimentary furniture, were a higher than usual single sleeping platform, a stool and a little table, all beautifully made from the inevitable bamboo.  It seemed a shame to burn it all but that was the custom so burn it they did.  But the point was that it had to be Ah Soo Chai\u2019s base for operations, because not only had British soldiers never been that Ah Soo Chye\u2019s s bad leg also meant he could not easily squat so he had been provided with stool, table and higher bed.  Pieces of furniture are unnatural for Nesiots (a generic term for such people) so it had to be a \u2018foreigner\u2019.  Suspicions that the guerrillas still had such a base in an area that Special Branch thought was clear of them and that Kerinching and they were still so close to one another were confirmed because the natural, Nesiot, pattern had been broken...\n\tInitially Kerinching was cautious of me.  He did not know that I already had a knowledge of Temiar (no non-Temiar had ever learnt the language) so I could listen in to what he said without his realising I could understand what he was talking about.  That led me to getting him to help me, using his brother, son and Ah Soo Chye\u2019s cook, scout and friend, Senagit, as the third.  Kerinching\u2019s conditions were only I and no one else to go, no resupply, a party of Gurkhas the size of a guerrilla group \u2013 I took nine so with me we were ten \u2013 and wear canvas shoes, not jungle boots, so as not to leave \u2018Security Force\u2019 footprints.\n\tOff we set with the Gurkhas carrying loads heavier than their body weight, my load only two kilograms lighter than mine.  Although I had learnt Temiarit took much long to learn their thought process so at times I was frustrated beyond redemption but I never showed impatience or anger.  Once I had their trust, it was only a matter of time, patience, perseverance, tact, more than our ration of good luck and I don\u2019t know what else before we could work positively \u2013 and we so very nearly had a bumper success.  I never laughed in front of the larger sorts of butterflies, which were seen as souls in transit \u2013 but to where?\n\tThe area I had to search for the rump of the guerrillas was so vast, 1,200 square hilly miles, that I had to get those Temiar who were not in cahoots with the guerrillas to search likely areas for clues of their movement while I and my nine Gurkhas hid up in a patch of jungle waiting developments, although even to get to a place where we could hide involved a lengthy approach march with the strictest security.  It was a novel experience to have to stay in an area the size of a basketball ground for, in the first instance, over six weeks.\n\tOne evening there was the biggest thunderstorm I had ever experienced and I was shattered by a deafening explosion nearby, as though we were being fired on by artillery.  I turned to the nearest Gurkha and asked what he thought that noise was.  \u2018It\u2019s because of the centipedes,\u2019 was his astonishing reply.  \u2018Centipedes?\u2019 I queried in disbelief.  \u2018Yes,\u2019 he said, \u2018they attract thunderbolts.\u2019  Ask a silly question...\n\tOne Temiar I became friendly with was named Senagit.  Before we had set out I had managed to have him cured from serious malaria.  It was that act that was the keystone to my using a Temiar screen of three men, three times for 52, 70 and 80 days, one kilogram of food lasting us for six days the while.\n\tI had been told that if I was successful it was highly likely that a Gurkha battalion would not be disbanded as the Ministry of Defence in London had been planning.  To keep a battalion in existence was a great challenge which helped us overcome our difficulties.  On one occasion I took some paper and a pencil and made out sentences in the six Asian languages I then knew and on another I took the New Testament in the Greek script.\n\tOur saga has been written up fully elsewhere but having to live for 202 days when one kilogram of food had to last us for six days, still haunts me more than sixty years later.  It was towards the end of our second period I had to have Senagit come back to our jungle hide-out in ten days\u2019 time.  He didn\u2019t know any number above three so I found a piece of string and tied ten knots into it.  When next Senagit visited us I told him to untie one knot every morning and come to see me when there were no knots left.\n\tHis smile of understanding such a wonderful idea remains with me yet: but in vain...\n\tEventually the guerrillas were so impressed with Gurkha tenacity and fortitude they never returned.\n*\nAnd, excuse me, the Gurkhas said they knew of no one else who could have replicated my performance, my language ability and my patience with the Temiar, with conversations going round and round and round for over an hour.  As for me it was my first epiphanyas regards my gurkhas \u2013 no grumbles and no sickness, with the British Special Forces CO telling my CO that he would not have committed his men on such operations.  And I now knew for good that \u2018enough is enough\u2019, what I could do without and get used to, how little I could manage with, how the mind can overcome hunger and fatigue...and not to worry if other people took no notice.\n*\nA passage in Captain Smith and Company by Robert Henriques reads: It is clear that the force of a happening is in its relevance\u2026for Experience, bred like a pearl from an irritation and its circumstance, must be long past before its worth or its limits may be recognised\u2026  I can so well remember wondering at critical times how I\u2019d think back on them after, say, fifty years: I\u2019d say to myself You\u2019re not wounded, only tired, hungry and a long way from base.  What\u2019s the matter?  There\u2019s nothing to be afraid of.  Get on with it.  If you are alive in fifty years\u2019 time, think back and then be afraid in safely I\u2019d upbraid my inner self!\nSince then my life has been simple, happy with basic wants, rejoicing in good health, peace of mind, something to eat when hungry, being able to change dirty clothes, to sleep dry, not to dig a hole before relieving myself, having books to read, a dog and...  No wonder people look at me with a touch of reserve, not quite understanding what makes me tick.  Is that why I been called \u2018The British Army\u2019s licensed eccentric\u2019?\n48***\nAnother bizarre incident: two of our rifle companies were over 50 miles from battalion HQ in Seremban, located next to a police station.  One night all the men in one barrack room were disturbed by a hand coming under each mosquito net and the end of the sleeper\u2019s penis severely pinched.  Such a matter had never before happened and one man was suspected.  When accused he pleaded ignorance.  The next night, in an effort not to provoke a crisis without proof of the perpetrator, a guard was put on the suspect\u2019s bed.\n\tHe never left his bed all night but each man had his penis pinched yet again.  This happened for another few nights.  Something strange was afoot.  The festive season of Dashera was upon us and my senior Gurkha officer smelt trouble.  He ordered all kukris to be put into the armoury.  Next morning, after a non-penis-pinching night, three truck loads of soldiers motored to Seremban for Dashera\u2019s main ceremony, I going on ahead in my car.\n\tThe convoy was late because one of the vehicles had overturned and one man had been killed \u2013 the suspect.  I got a phone call from the very irate and indignant European in charge of the police station to tell me how one of my men had entered a married quarter and forcibly snuggled in between husband and wife.  \u2018I most strongly object...\u2019  I let him carry on, apologised and told him that that very man had died that morning.  I did not tell him that, until that night, inexplicable matters had occurred in the dead man\u2019s barrack room.\n\tOur soldiers put the whole strangeness to the man\u2019s soul, knowing it was to be let loose fairly soon, going on the rampage.\n49***\nIndians have an ability in strangeness that few other people have.  One aspect of this is the art of levitation. Two adults and a young boy were involved and the only props needed were a sheet, a wooden pole, a small frame and a hoop.\n\tFirst the lad was laid on the ground under the frame and his right hand took hold of the wooden pole as high as he could reach.  The boy was then put into a trance and the sheet was draped over the frame so the boy could not be seen.\n\tOur attention was occupied for a few minutes and then one of the adults returned to the frame, lifted the sheet and there was the boy some way off the ground, still holding on to the stick and body stiff  The hoop was passed over the boy\u2019s body to show that it was not being held up by any straps we could not see from where we sat.\n\tThe sheet was put back and after a few more minutes the sheet was taken off once more and there was the boy, still holding on to the stick but now horizontal with the ground, body stiff.  The hoop was once more passed over his body with nothing to stop its passage.  Once more the sheet was draped over the frame and after another few minutes the boy was uncovered and we saw that he was half way down, body as rigid as ever.\n\tThe sheet was draped over him and when lifted the boy was flat on the ground, arm still clutching the stick.  He was recovered from his trance and, looking dazed, was taken away.  The chief adult came to me to write up my appreciation and, looking through what had already been written, found, to my amazement, a certificate of commendation I had written a few years previously.\n50***\nEarly on during my ten years in the jungle I made a golden rule that, when there was a halt, no one would be allowed to smoke for five minutes.  This was in case any guerrillas were in the immediate vicinity and would otherwise be aware of our presence by cigarette smoke if not by noise.  It had paid off in the past and it paid off again.  An armed and uniformed Chinese youth walked straight into us and was shot.  He fell to the ground.  I went over to him to give succour and he died as I had my hands on his body, the death rattle, convulsing his throat, spent itself in the silence of the jungle.\n\tDuring the next few days I found my strength and appetite waning.  I was ordered back to battalion HQ without any reason given.  By myself I walked the edge of the jungle, feeling weak.  I was met by a scout car and driven back over an hour\u2019s winding hill miles away.  That type of vehicle held three people, a driver and two Bren gunners.  The arrangement for the gunners was simple: twin-mounted light machine guns were fixed onto a metal stalk outside on the roof and fired by cable attached to bicyle-style handle-bars from inside.  The seat this gunner sat on could be elevated, so when the sliding lid-like roof was open, the whole was raised sufficiently for his head to protrude.  This was cooler than being cooped up inside.  The second gunner sat right down in the front of the scout car, next to the driver, at the feet of the first gunner.\n\tSoon after we started I began to feel uncomfortable.  By the time we were winding over the top of a mountain pass I felt I had to vomit.  I stopped the driver, jumped out and retched emptily.  I sat gloomily by the side of the road while the two Gurkhas waited patiently.  Presently they suggested we move on.  Once again in the scout car I felt we were moving with incredible speed.  \u2018Slow down, slow down!\u2019 I begged the driver.  Apparently we were moving very slowly.  I felt fish-belly cold and lowered my seat to get warm.  A dizziness assailed me and I must have started behaving queerly.  The driver turned to the other man and said something I could not fully catch, \u2018...has affected him.\u2019  An uncontrollable impulse made me bend forward and embrace the gunner for warmth.  I dimly heard the answer, \u2018But he is a Christian.  His church will protect him.\u2019\n\tAny effect my religion might have had was thought to have worn off so I was told to sit up and, shakily, I did.  Because I had to be smart in Seremban I had called into a neighbouring battalion where I had left some clothes and shoes which wore polished shoes but they had got muddy when I left the vehicle earlier.  The driver, Kalibahadur Limbu, a shaman in his own right, turned and scratched some earth from my shoes onto his finger, then scratched some polish off both toe-caps.\n\tKalibahadur spat on the mixture, making a paste of it.  He began to mutter but I was too uninterested and remote to care how he was driving or to listen to what he was saying.  He dabbed my forearms with the paste, my forehead and the tip of my tongue.  \u2018That should do it,\u2019 he told his companion.\n\tAlmost immediately I felt a ball inside the pit of my stomach pushing up and up.  I gasped as it struggled against my throat, choking me.  As it burst through I started sobbing out loud.  I pulled myself together and, feeling warmer, told the driver to drive normally.  This he did, saying nothing. \n\tWithin ten minutes I was better, although I felt utterly worn out.  I was to learn that the guerrilla\u2019s soul had entered into mine when I was touching him as he died.  I have since learnt that Christian exorcism has the same effect as Kalibahadur\u2019s had on me.\n\tAs we drove into the camp the two Gurkhas saw my fianc\u00e9e Jane and waved to her.  I was so slow in reacting that I did not wave and I saw a shadow cross her face.  She scolded me when we met later on that evening.  I apologised.  During the next few days, we completed the arrangements for our accommodation and, finally, bought the ring and a wedding veil.  However, with only a few days to go, the local brigadier ordered me back into the jungle.  Information from the dead man\u2019s diaries and my personal knowledge of the area meant I had to be there to take advantage of the situation.\n\tIt was too much for Jane.  She wrote me a letter, unsigned, to be air-dropped to me, telling me she would have left Malaya by the time I got it.  I was unexpectedly flown out of the jungle; we had a torrid meeting and she left the next day.  A woman, speaking in English, telephoned me from Singapore but I was not there to answer.  \u2018When love is over, what of love does even the lover understand?\u2019\n\tI was so angry for the rest of the time I was a company commander on jungle operations I went on my patrols that did my non-coms, thus gaining immense experience.  So much, in fact, that I was one of very fewmajors who had failed the Staff College Entrance Examination to be promoted to lieutenant colonel to command the JWS.  Better off unmarried?  Thought: a good wife is a harbour in a storm but a bad wife is a storm in a harbour.\n*\nAfter Jane had left me those officers who were happily married were sad: those who weren\u2019t were jealous.  I asked one of the latter if it was true \u2018that the unhappiest person in the world is the married bachelor?\u2019  He lowered the newspaper he was reading and, looking at me beadily, said \u2018no, it is the married bachelor\u2019s wife.\u2019\n51***\nMalaya became independent on 31 August 1957.  I was on the staff then (for the first and last time in my service) and not enjoying it so, when I was sent on a mission over the independence celebrations, I was pleased.\n\tIt had been thought that Chin Peng might well start some trouble during this period, knowing that by then there were fewer troops in the country and almost all of those that were there had to be taking part in the celebrations thereby giving him (Chin Peng) a head start.  British Army HQ in Kuala Lumpur had been sent down to Seremban and the Malayan Army, more correctly the Federation Military Forces, now reigned (almost) supreme where before they had been but junior and embryo partners.\n\tThe theorists had thought thus: if Chin Peng came down into Malaya on the west side of the country, which was unlikely, there were good roads for reinforcements as well as airfields.  If he chose the centre of the country, below the Betong Salient, there was little or nothing that could be done about it, even if it were heard about.  \tThat left the east, with a road that had then to cross ten ferries, so was too slow for any rapidly required deployment but which did have a good airfield not far from the border at Kota Bahru.  This area was unlikely to be used but there had been a misappreciation of the threat (the uncharitable called it something else), so precautions were taken.  In order for there to be transport at the airfield in the event of an emergency, I was ordered to move up the road with a convoy of seventeen Land Rovers and their trailers.\n\tIt was a hotchpotch assortment of drivers, British and Gurkha, that assembled at Seremban.  We were escorted by armoured cars for the first part of the journey, which was slow, hot and, in places, very dusty.\n\tOn the second day we had to cross the majority of the ferries.  In places the road jinked inland so the river to be crossed was narrow, thus operations were comparatively speedy even though only two Land Rovers and their trailers were able to be handled at one time.  More often than not the ferries were placed at the mouths of the rivers, where the crossings were affected by the tides to an extent that one particular river took seven hours to cross.  The convoy became very spread out.\n\tI travelled at the rear, towards the end of that day, 30 August 1957, but went forward to choose a site for that night and eventually settled on an area by the beach at the edge of the Kuala Trengganu Club.  Having fixed up details as well as I could, I drove back down the road, hoping to gather everyone in by dusk.\n\tHeavy rain and breakdowns resulted in the last vehicle arriving at midnight with, for me, that morning\u2019s meal.  The ground around the clubhouse was inches deep in water.  Thunder and lightning were almost continuous.  The only dry place for the driver and me was a table we found.  Up we clambered, having ushered in Independence Day in the most dismal of circumstances.\n\tNext morning we dried ourselves out as best we could and drove off northwards.  I gathered later that our progress out of the town caused quite a stir.  A parade was being held to mark the end of British colonial rule.  Police, Home Guard, Boy Scouts, Girl Guides, Boys\u2019 Brigade and the First Aid fraternities were all in three ranks, with school children less well marshalled and a watching crowd of spectators all dressed in their finery.  A Malay speech had been made and now an English one was being given.  A clipped, staccato voice was saying, \u2018...and now we are looking after ourselves having shaken the British off...\u2019 when a low rumble of transport was heard.  All heads craned as the first, then second Land Rover and trailer hove into sight along the road abutting the parade ground.  No interest in the parade was paid until the seventeenth had been counted and was out of sight.  Just having moved off the spacing between the vehicles was equidistant and very impressive.  Damp and bored soldiers scowled as they drove past, giving an unwarranted impression of power and control.  The noise died away and the reedy voice resumed its paean of self praise to the multitude. \u2018...from now on we are on our own.\u2019\n\tUp in Kota Bahru the celebration parade had been, if anything, less successful.  A cage of pigeons, mounted on a stand, was in front of and to one side of the main dais.  Men in traditional warrior dress, carrying staves, were its escort.  An artillery piece was to boom out independence joy as the pigeons were liberated when the roof of the cage was lifted back.  The Chief Minister of Kelantan had, unfortunately, muddled his notes up and reached the climax of his speech before he should have done.  A recording of the new national anthem, which had only arrived the day before, was started at the previously notified juncture, but alas! the record was cracked and no one had realised it.  In the embarrassingly unrehearsed hiatus before it had dawned on anyone to turn the thing off or to jolt it on a revolution, the Chief Minister realised that he had skipped a page or two and turned back.  His fluttering hands were mistaken for the signal for the artillery piece to boom, which it did, several times.  There was no stopping it.  Back was flung the lid of the pigeons\u2019 cage but so frightened were the birds by the noise that they remained just where they were.  The last boom died away, the shrill scratch of the record was becoming even more scratchy, when an old retainer, one of the warriors guarding the pigeons\u2019 cage, took the initiative.  Lifting up his staff he ignominiously poked it through the bars, thinking presumably that that would cause the recalcitrant birds to become airborne.  The birds, however, had different ideas on the subject.  They bounced and shuffled to the far end of the cage only to be poked back again, ignominiously, by their staff-wielding keeper.  Only after considerable effort did he manage to get the birds away but at least he had the crowd\u2019s sympathy as the ill-omened birds rose into the air, only to flutter down nearby and start waddling petulantly, looking for food.\n\tWe stayed in Kota Bahru for a few days and carried out some reconnaissances.  After watching the celebrations, which included kite flying and boat racing, we drove back to Seremban.  We were not best pleased to learn that the expedition would never have been sent if the person who had originally assessed the situation had not been on leave at the time and his \u2018stand-in\u2019 had read the small print.  But thus is history written \u2013 and anyway it got me away from my desk for a few days.\nHONG K ONG: 1959-1961\n52***\nLife in Hong Kong was entirely different from what we had grown used to in the ten previous years in Malaya.  We were stationed away from the island to the north of Kowloon in the New Territories.  One night I arranged a company patrol exercise which featured about six patrols half a mile apart and at various points of the compass.  Their task was to move to a central point, an expanse of sandy waste where I waited, then on to where the patrol opposite them had started without letting the other side know of their presence.\n\tAs I waited there was no wind or moonlight.  Much sooner than expected I heard shuff, shuff, shuff, like people walking softly but seeming not going in any particular direction, then a little later more shuff, shuff, shuff, the tread equally muffled and untraceable.  I wanted to know which patrols they were but even though I called loudly both times I heard the shuffling I got no answer.  I stood up and tried to contact them but saw nobody.  I noted the time.  Later I saw patrols pass, moving more noisily, and, once we were all together at the end of the exercise, I asked which patrols had passed by at such-and-such a time.  None had, nor had I expected an answer as I had counted them.\n\tIt was only later that I learnt that that place was shunned by locals as it was said to be haunted.  In 1949 when Mao Tse-tung's men crossed the border in pursuit of Nationalists, scores of soldiers had been killed around that spot.  It was uselessly intriguing to try and fathom which lot of shuff, shuff, shuff was being chased or doing the chasing.\n53***\nDishonesty, we learn, does not always pay: some Gurkhas had their families with them in Hong Kong.  All Gurkha children born in Hong Kong were eligible for Hong Kong citizenship.  So that such children would not be aliens in the land of their parents' birth, their birth certificate had to be made out to give their father's village.  For the Hong Kong authorities to allow such people to get work permits, the fact that their birth was in Hong Kong had to be shown on their Nepalese papers.  In Nepal Chief District Officers, known as CDOs, were empowered to alter the paperwork to show a Hong Kong birth but had to have the relevant proof from British Army records.  An impoverished ex \u2013Hillman soldier, whose son was born in Hong Kong, sold his son's birth certificate to a Menial, whose son was a good hand at computer work, for a large sum. Menial\u2019s son went to Hong Kong in the name of the Hillman's son, made excellent money but got killed.  His firm sent his \u2018father\u2019, the Hillman, compensation to the equivalent of \u00a325,000.  The Menial\u2019s father accused Hillman father of killing his son whereupon the Hillman father accused Menial father of trying to steal the money.  Both men reported their grievance to the police who ruled that both should be locked up then promptly put the money into the Police Benevolent Fund.\nBORNEO: 1963-1964\n54***\nDuring the uneasy lull between the Brunei rebellion in 1962 and the founding of Malaysia in 1963, a force of Auxiliary Police, the Borneo Border Scouts was raised, the border being that of British and Indonesian Borneo.  They were to be the \u2018eyes and ears\u2019 of the Security Forces, with a \u2018sting\u2019.  Being local men, based on their own longhouses, knowing their own fields and backwoods, recognising friend and foreigner, it was hoped that they would provide adequate early warning of Indonesian incursions for positive action speedily to be taken.\n\tHowever, it was not easy.  There were two colonies involved, Sarawak and British North Borneo, both of which dealt directly with London and, as I found out, hardly on speaking terms with one another.  Neither had much longer as colonies and understandably did not want to become involved in something that a new state might not want.  Despite misgivings in both colonies, there was a real need for such an organisation, so plans had been made to raise them.\n\tApparently my experience with the Temiar made me the choice to look after the new organization.  I was not available as I had been sent on leave in England to recover from total exhaustion after working with the Temiar.  Halfway through my leave I was recalled to be the Borneo Border Scouts\u2019 Commandant.  It was an unusual challenge.  On my way out in Singapore I was told that the Scouts were policemen, not soldiers, so would I therefore also be a policeman?  If they were and I was not, could I be put under arrest by one of my own men?  I was told that 22 Special Air Service Regiment and the Gurkha Independent Parachute Company were raising and training the Scouts.  As a policeman, how would I fit in?\n\tI flew on to Brunei where the controlling headquarters was and was briefed about the country, the political situation and about my new task.  It appeared that Indonesian Confrontation would succeed if so much pressure was brought to bear on the Border peoples that either they were absorbed by the opposition or forced to evacuate their border homelands.  If the border peoples could be made to feel that they were taking an active part in their own defence, and the Government was behind them, then Confrontation would probably fail.  If not, Confrontation would probably succeed.  The Border Scouts, besides being what their name implied, would so associate the border peoples with their own defence that a successful Border Scouts could spell the doom of Confrontation as far as the border peoples were concerned.  The converse was also true.  I was told that it was up to me \u2013 one man \u2013 to make the organisation work.  I realised all too plainly the enormous responsibility given to me and I felt all too inadequate to cope with it \u2013 and as soon as I started to work I realised that the Scouts had been completely wrongly trained and wrongly armed for their task but, alas, not only was it too late to start again but also I had yet to work out the best way to use them, hence to best way to train them properly.\n\tSarawak was then divided into five Divisions, numbered one to five.  British North Borneo, later to be renamed Sabah, was split into four Residencies, named the Interior, Tawau, East Coast and West Coast.  This last contained the capital, then named Jessleton, and the island of Labuan.  My parish at first only covered Sarawak, but later included, for a few months, the Interior and Tawau Residences.  In all I counted thirty different tongues spoken.  My main language was Malay, modified to meet local peculiarities.  I also used Iban extensively and, only when I had to, English.\n\tAt that time I had been sent on leave in England to recover from total exhaustion after working with the Temiar below the Malay-Thai border.  Halfway through my leave I was recalled to be the Borneo Border Scouts\u2019 Commandant.  It was an unusual challenge.

My main language was Malay, modified to meet local peculiarities.  I also used Iban extensively and, only when I had to, English.\nBut I was unique.  No terms of service had ever existed for a British Army officer to be seconded to the Sarawak Constabulary.  I was posted out of my battalion and, by way of a non-existent, paper-only appointment, was temporarily attached back to my battalion.  In the meantime I had been sworn in as a Superintendent of Sarawak Constabulary.  The Treasury of Great Britain was only happy to pay me as long as Sarawak was a Crown Colony and I a soldier, but Sarawak wanted me as a policeman.  I was made a local lieutenant colonel in the British Army and the Constabulary offered me a captain\u2019s salary.  This I refused.  Sarawak then said as they would soon no longer exist they could offer me nothing.  I went across to Kuala Lumpur and asked what Malaysia would offer.  I was told that as Malaysia did not then exist they could tell me nothing.  So I asked what Malaya thought and was equally politely told that, as far as Malaya was concerned, Sarawak\u2019s affairs interested them not one whit.  I returned to Kuching gloomily.\n\tOn Malaysia becoming a country I was attached to the Federation Army as an acting Lieutenant Colonel, posted to the Ministry of Defence, who posted me to the Ministry of Internal Security, who posted me to the Royal Malaysia Police who could not post me to the Sarawak Constabulary because I was there already.  By that time I had been sworn in as a Superintendent of the Sabah Police Force.  Belonging then to two different armies and three different police contingents, the next step was obvious - no one could decided whose responsibly I really was and until that knotty problem was solved no one felt able to pay me.  I had broken the rules.  I had beaten the system.  I was a headache.  I wasted far more time than I was ever worth.  It took just over ten months to sort the problem out.  Meanwhile the Sarawak government paid for my accommodation and I managed to eke out my existence on a police daily living allowance.\n\t\tDuring this time life was one continuous move.  In one year and two days, I spent no longer than three days in any one place at any one time, except in August when I was five days in one place, the last two waiting for a helicopter to pick me up.  I should have walked out.  Life became more and more exhausting.  Every longhouse I went to the head man there had to be the one man who mattered.  My diet ranged from bully beef when I visited British troops and of rotting monkey via dollops of pig fat and rice cakes when I visited villages.  I remonstrated with Residents, argued with army officers, pleaded with policemen and genially gesticulated with generals.  Slowly, ever so slowly, the Border Scouts took shape.  In my questings and journeyings I learnt much, saw much, had much to be thankful for \u2013 and once a month on average only the dhobi and myself knew how frightened I was.\n\tMy uniform was normal \u2018jungle green\u2019.  I travelled by road a little, river and air much,and walked well over a thousand miles.  I am not a vain man but the only time I would ever describe myself as \u2018soft and attractive\u2019 was when I referred to myself as a military target in the border areas.\n55***\nAn early task was to go and give an opening address to an indigenous leaders\u2019 course in an Iban-speaking area.  I spoke in Malay for forty-five minutes as, regrettably my Iban, the lingua franca of that area, was not up to standard.  That previous evening we had a drama as five of the students, previously ear-marked for corporal by the Chief Policeman and the Resident had already stitched on their tapes, claiming they had been authorised.  No one had warned me about it and I was nonplussed by such an interference with my jurisdiction.  It was difficult to deal with as the Resident had already left the area and the Policeman was about to.  Also, to take away the tapes, added to Iban stubbornness, would make a greater loss of face even harder to deal with.  Neither had we any knowledge as to whether the five men were telling the truth thus making reconciliation between fact and fiction even more difficult than otherwise.  So I \u2018did a Solomon\u2019 on them: I said I would not order them to take off their tapes but would leave it to them.  If they wished to wear them \u2013 okay, if they wished to get rid of them \u2013 okay: pause for prolonged discussion, followed by my saying that, having kept their tapes on, think of the shame at the end of the course if they failed to make the grade and had to take them off then.  In the end I won and as they had taken them off of their own accord, there would never be counter-accusations of my shaming them in front of their fellow men.  Apart from anything else it was a good exercise for my linguistic capabilities (Malay), it was also a good example of just how touchy Ibans could be and that how long settling a crisis like that could take to sort out.\n\tThat afternoon we played a game of football.  As we were all mixed shirts and bare-buff recognition of friend and foe was not easy.  I had one devastating half minute when I showed wizardry with the ball, dribbling it around an opponent so effectively that he lost his balances and I, after many a fancy twirl, emerged triumphant.  It rather deflated my ego to realise, a little later on, that far from beating an opponent twenty years younger than myself on the ball, he was one of my own side trying to get out of the way!\n56***\nAfter one lot of training of local leaders had finished I had to go to their Passing Out Parade.  I went, via 2/10 GR, spending the night with them and finalising my little speech, and then by chopper to Enkilili, so I descended, deus ex machina, on the parade ground.  The pilot was one Tug Wilson who had taken me to eastern Perak on 18 July 1962.  There was a thick mist so we had to fly at tree-top level, following the road \u2018taking the right fork\u2019 some three miles from our destination.  We landed, the pilot switched off.  I climbed down, was met by a British officer lent from a Gurkha battalion for the training and his senior Iban aide, the heli pilot allowed me enough time to go across the football field, get onto the dais before starting up and flying away.  I felt very grand, dressed in my finery, including medals, but ever so slightly foolish.  The parade presented arms.  I was reported to and we inspected the men.  I thought I would get the most out of my medals, so I walked faster than normal up the back of all three ranks so my medals should clink  The parade marched past, I pinned on tapes, gave other insignia away and gave them a short closing address.  I believe I rather heightened the effect by wrongly quoting an Iban proverb: some climb up the monkey-puzzle tree, some up some other tree, which I had thought meant we all have different sorts of luck and fate but in fact only refers to those who get to the top by unfair means.  However I was led to believe that the message went home better that way as it was taken as referring to the five men who tried to start the course as corporals.  We then left for the Border Scouts camp, half a mile away.  I had much to talk about with the instructors and had also to write my report, so the day passed quickly and pleasantly enough.\nThe party, thrown by the Ibans was scheduled to start at 7.  It went on all night but I, exercising the privileges that rank and age bestow, got to bed before midnight.  There was an Iban \u2018band\u2019 at the party and the instruments were at one both pleasant and discordant.  Gongs and various metallic clashes combined with different sized drums produced a cacophony not unpleasant.  The Iban dances, chiefly modelled on warrior and self-defence gestures, were good to watch.  Later the inevitable \u2019ronggeng\u2019 came: man and man or man and woman, pirouetting and unjoined, to and fro.  I was pulled out and with a mixture of straight-laced grace and twinkling eye brought much acclaim and laughter.  All good clean fun!...but how I yearned for an early bed!\n57***\nOne of the British police officers I met in Kuching told me how, when only a probationary officer, his Chinese fried had told him that he and his group were unhappy about something or other they wanted to go on a march to show their anger.\n\t\u2018Let me go and ask advice first,\u2019 the police officer said.  \u2018I don\u2019t want you to get into trouble.\u2019\n\tSo saying he went to ask his superior officer, unusually posted in from Hong Kong.  The latter\u2019s answer was that he\u2019d go and speak to them in Chinese.  So the two of them called the potential striker and the senior officer harangued him in Chinese.  As he left he said to the probationer \u2018you\u2019d better learn their language.  That\u2019s the best way to control the people.\u2019\n\tThe probationary officer asked his Chinese friend if he was now going to go on their march of protest.\n\t\u2018No, no.  We won\u2019t march now.\u2019\n\t\u2018I am glad.  You won\u2019t get into trouble.  By the way what did he say to you?\u2019\n\t\u2018I have no idea.  I didn\u2019t understand a word he said but he was obviously very angry.\u2019\n58***\nOne incident typified Ibans\u2019 way of thinking.  A section of Iban Border Scouts commanded by a Gurkha corporal found Gurkha discipline too harsh for them so they told the Gurkha that they would take his head off.  The canny Gurkha told them that they would have to get the permission of the company commander in the local military camp which happened to be the Gurkha\u2019s own company commander.  One man was left in camp to guard it.\n\tSo, less on man who had to stay behind and guard the camp, the section was \u2018fallen in\u2019 and marched to the company commander\u2019s officer and, standing to attention, the Gurkha told the Major what the Ibans had wanted.  The Major told them it was not possible and dismissed them.\n\tThey happily marched back to camp, the Gurkha pleased that he had headed off trouble and the Ibans that they had been taken seriously \u2013 all except the unfortunate man left in camp who was threatened with his head being cut off because he had not shown his mettle in front of the company commander.\n\tWithout telling anyone he crept away and stated his case in front of the Major who gave the same answer: the man, head high at being taken seriously, returned to the camp.  So, in its own small way, one problem was properly, but differently, sorted out.\n59***\nI was asked by the CO of a Royal Malay Regiment battalion to check the border of his unit\u2019s tactical area and Indonesia.  He said that the Border Scouts in his area were not any use and I was to find out why.  I did and it was because the Malay soldiers gave them tasks they were not trained for, they themselves were unenthusiastic about patrolling and looked down on the scouts as they were not Malays.\nMy companion was a Dyak Probationary Inspector, George Young Siricord, who was under instruction.  Three days later we reached Plaman Mapu around noon, having avoided two Malay ambushes in areas the CO had said there were no troops.   An agitated headman hustled us inside and upstairs, into the loft, where we were ordered to hide from approaching Indonesians.  This was unexpected news, certainly no intelligence reports had suggested such a large force to be in the offing, although we had heard rumours of an intended incursion while at Bunan Gagak.  I asked what the Indonesians expected to achieve and got the chilling response that they would exterminate Europeans \u2013 \u2018We hate them like dogs\u2019 - would ambush airdrops and had the Border Scouts, security forces and Government servants as targets.  Once more the idea of being a \u2018soft and attractive military target in the border areas\u2019 struck me as, by representing each prong of that unholy trinity, the odds were heavily against us.\n\tAt dusk we were called down and offered some rice and vegetables.  Neither of us had much of an appetite.  Our equipment had been hidden and we only had our weapons with us.  I had taken the precaution of extracting a towel from my pack, for use as a pillow-cum-head binder to keep as many nasties as possible from going down my ears.  George and I were lying on the bamboo-slatted floor and I was on the verge of taking off my boots when, at half past 7, the dogs started barking, not merely baying at the moon but the kind that is set off by human beings.  It was decided we had better be hidden.\n\tPart of the bamboo slats was rolled back and we were told to jump down the six or so feet and hide in a narrow trench that had been dug for the headman, as a gesture of good will by the Marines who had been relieved by the Malays, in the event of the longhouse being shelled.  This we did, with urgent whispers imploring us to hurry.  Once we were under the floor, a man rolled the bamboo slats back in position and placed his sleeping mat over the \u2018trap door\u2019.  It was hoped he would act as a decoy if the Indonesians were to enter the house.\n\tUnderneath it stank of stale rubbish, pigs, curs and chickens.  We squirmed ourselves as comfortably as we could, our arms pinioned to our sides.  I managed to put the towel over my head and draped it over my face as we soon found ourselves beset with rats.  George wriggled and moaned, bringing whispered curses and pleas for silence from above.\n\tDogs barked again at 10 o\u2019clock.  The rats continued to run over us and George\u2019s struggles to keep his face clear caused the earthen walls of the trench to start crumbling.  More agonised whispers demanding quiet came from above.\n\tI have to admit I heard nothing, apart from George\u2019s struggles and the whispers, sibilantly impassioned, requesting quiet.  I knew I could do nothing about the danger and a strange calm overcame me.  I now knew what danger I was up against, so could the better face it.  Sleep was imperative, so I went to sleep.\n\tWhat with George\u2019s squirming, the rats running over me and my moving my head from side to side, the towel slipped off.  I was awoken by a large rat sitting on my nose.  Instinctively, knowing that I could not get my hands to brush it off, I blew up, violently, through my mouth and it scuttled off.  I managed to drape the towel more firmly and continued my sleep, albeit intermittently.  It started to rain heavily.\n\tAt dawn we went up to the loft and, within half an hour, we had heard that more than seventy Indonesians had moved north at 7 o\u2019clock the night before.  Later another man reported that there had been two groups, one of six armed, hatless and bearded enemy a short distance away, at 6 o\u2019clock.  He had spoken to them.  The second, and larger, group of a hundred and twenty men had skirted the longhouse and had gone deeper into Sarawak.  The reason why the Indonesians had not investigated the longhouse George and I were under was thought to be because they had found out that the Malay platoon was not there and had not suspected our presence.\n\tI felt that I should try and get this news known about as soon as possible, but, probably just as well, my request was turned down.\n\tBy mid-morning the rain had stopped, so I once more asked the headman if I could leave, as I was certain there would be no helicopter that day.  We had been given back our equipment and we could try to make a dash for it.\n\t\u2018Please do not go as long as the enemy are in the area.  If they were to know that I had hidden you, they would punish me with my life.  This is their threat.\u2019\n\tAt 2 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, twenty-six hours after we had arrived at the longhouse, we heard the sound of a helicopter.  I hardly dared believe my ears.  As soon as I was sure it was coming our way, George and I ran the 200 yards to where we had been told it would land, if it came - and come it had!\n\tIt was an RAF Whirlwind, which meant we could hurl ourselves in and not wait to be strapped in.  I had taken the precaution of writing down, on a scrap of paper, GO TO SERIAN.  Having thrown my kit in and shouted to George to get in, I showed it to the pilot, who looked down, read it and shook his head.  He had been briefed to go to another place so could not deviate without permission from Kuching; this was his first operational mission.  I climbed up the outside and put my head into the cockpit.  I pulled the pilot over to me, lifted his helmet and shouted, over the noise of the engine, \u2018There\u2019s an incursion and a hundred enemy are in the area.  They\u2019ve threatened to shoot down a helicopter they can.  You\u2019re the first in.\u2019\n\tHe needed no second bidding.  I jumped down, got in and tapped his leg from behind, the sign that we inside were ready for takeoff.  I sat between the door and the front end and, as the helicopter took off, a deal faster than it had landed, there were tears in my eyes that could not have been caused by the slipstream.  My only regret was that I had not thanked the villagers, and especially the headman, adequately for their help.\n\tSo we flew to Serian, where I got out.  George had had enough and went on to Kuching.  I told the CO about the situation but he seemed little interested.  There was nothing on the \u2018sitrep\u2019 from his troops about any incursion so, as far as he was concerned, there was no incursion.\n\tDuring the evening Brigadier Patterson rang through.  George and the pilot had reported the incident.  The Malay colonel gave the brigadier an evasive reply.  Feeling unbearably tired, I excused myself and went to bed.\n\tBy then I had been on the move constantly for nearly a year and when I awoke of a morning I had always known exactly where I was: for the record, since I had left England, I had spent three hundred and twenty=one nights out and, of these, two hundred and nine never in the same place longer than one or two nights, and the remaining one hundred and twelve not longer than three.  However, next morning, on waking, I had not the faintest idea where I was.  I was frightened: was I in hospital, jail, a lunatic asylum or where?  I lay back, cowering at the implications of knowing nothing, and it was only some minutes later when someone came into my room to see what had happened to me that I learnt what I so desperately wanted to know.\n\tThe rest of the story is of no concern here.\n60***\nI went on a tour as satellite with my two bosses, the Inspector General of the Royal Malaysia Police (IGPOL) and the Director of Borneo Operations, (DOBOPS) a Major General, who did not see eye-to-eye on anything.  While at a training camp at Jambu eating a sandwich lunch an elderly Iban sidled up to the two generals and asked if the two of them could go to his longhouse.  He was a retired pengara, one who is senior to all penghulus, head men.  He was sent to me and IGPOL\u2019s message was for me to look into what he wanted after the tour.\n\tThe elderly Iban came to me, sitting apart by myself.  I asked him, in Iban, his name: Empikau.  He had eighteen tattoo marks on the back of all his fingers, spreading onto the back of his left hand.  I asked him the reason: a mark was tattooed for each head he had lopped off.\n\tIn due course I sent a message to Empikau who sent me two men to where I was in the Border Scout camp at Jambu to take me to his house.  I was skilfully navigated downstream by them.  I had two armed Border Scouts with me, more as status symbols than any deterrent against possible Indonesian nastiness on our way downstream.\n\tEmpikau\u2019s house, twenty doors long, lay between the strongly-flowing Sumpa and Ai rivers.  We climbed up a notched pole onto the long verandah.\n\tI was shown some floor space opposite Empikau\u2019s private door.  I put down my pack, took off my jungle boots and put on \u2018flip-flops\u2019.  I felt it better not to be armed so gave my rifle to one of my gunmen.  I was invited into Empikau\u2019s room and sat down with him on the bamboo-slatted floor.  Rice beer was offered in two glasses, one small and one large.  The smaller glass was lifted first and, having been brought up to the mouth as though to be drunk, was poured through the slats onto the ground below to appease some of Empikau\u2019s gods.  The larger glasses were for us and I was ordered to drink mine up.  Although a strict teetotaller, I did so as not to cause offence.  I refused a refill but ate the rice meal.  Empikau was old enough not to worry about drinking more than a guest.  I could not tell how much he could stomach, but I guessed an all-night session would cause him little discomfort.\n\tEmpikau took me back onto the communal verandah.  Outside it was dark and raining.  We two sat with our backs to the outer wall.  The two Border Scouts had eaten in another room and sat well away from us, one still with my rifle.  Gradually the men of the longhouse came and sat, in serried rows, facing us.  They were a strong-looking bunch and, in the dim light of the open-wicked lamps, the flickering shadows made their unsmiling faces relentlessly stern and satanic.  There were about forty-five of them, young and old.  They sat, silent and staring, their eyes boring into mine whenever I looked up at them.\n\tIt was either pique that riled him when I had told him that could in no way influence the unpopular decision about moving the longhouse northwards to evade Indonesian attacks, chagrin at my refusal of more drink, or, having been drinking all day, his recent consumption had induced a state of aggressiveness, Empikau started to pick a quarrel with me.\n\tEmpikau, no stickler for protocol, started savagely berating me.  To him I embodied all that threatened his treasured lifestyle.  After about twenty minutes of castigating me severely as epitomising the enemy, he jumped up and took a Japanese sword that had been behind a door.  Unsheathing it he threatened to take my head off, like he had done to former enemies.  I was told to look up at the rafters.  I saw a hideous bunch of blackened skulls above me.  \u2018There are eighteen of them,\u2019 Empikau said.  I took his word for it!\n\tI had learnt how he had got the sword, a Japanese one: he had captured its owner during the war, broken both his ankles and wrists and thrown him under the floor onto the ground where, on elbows and knees, he had vied with the dogs to pick up any scraps off the ground.  He was dead before two weeks were out.\n\tI turned my terrified gaze from the skulls to Empikau, to the men who were still staring unwaveringly at me.  Their expressions were set, without regard, without remorse, without regret.  They were all at one with Empikau.  I was horror-struck.  The old man still had his sword over me, poised, ready.\n\tDid I have a reason why my head shouldn\u2019t be the nineteenth?  I glanced at him and the implacably staring eyes of his men sitting in front of me.  The atmosphere was unbearably tense.  My throat was dry but the sweat of raw, animal fear had yet to break.  Escape was impossible.\n\tArgument was out of the question.  \u2018No reason at all, old man,\u2019 I managed to blurt out in Iban, desperately trying to appear calm.  \u2018I am your guest, but tonight I am tired and you must be too from working all day.  Also the light is dim.  Put away your sword and use it tomorrow when it is light, after you have had a good night\u2019s rest.  Your aim will be better then.\u2019\n\tThere was an endless pause of a few seconds while Empikau considered what I had said.  My soft answer must have turned away his anger, because he sheathed his sword, put it away behind the door and, ludicrously and unnecessarily I thought, sat down once more beside me.\n\tAfter what seemed an age, a bard started singing pantuns at the end of the house and Empikau got up and went over to him.  Pantuns are rhyming couplets and now the bard was recounting glories of past deeds; he had earned a gallantry medal during the war and now, embellished with my present hapless situation, my fate on the morrow was being intoned.  Gradually the others rose and left to listen to the bard.  I sat on alone and it was then that the sweat of fear broke out, running down my nose.  I heard the drops hitting the rice-straw mat I was sitting cross-legged on.\n\tMy two escorts were wisely not in view, hiding somewhere I presumed, not that there was much they could have done.  After a few minutes of lonely introspection, the headman\u2019s wife came over to me and directed me into an empty room, with a rice-straw mat to sleep on.  She locked the door behind me and, mentally worn out, I fell into a troubled sleep.\n\tAt dawn was I glad when my two Border Scouts unlocked the door to let me out?  They were as anxious to get away from Nanga Sumpa as I was, but I felt it wrong to leave without having the last word with Empikau.  My fear had turned to anger by this time.  I sought him out and had a few terse words, my courage fortified by seeing his anger had cooled since the previous evening\u2019s encounter.\n\tLate afternoon the three of us stumbled into the nearest security force camp downstream, a Gurkha platoon base.  Foodless, we had walked all day to get there and I, for one, was tired out.  Never did mug of tea brewed especially for me taste better!\n61***\nIn January 1964, I was targeted to make a Borneo-wide survey-cum-assessment of the Border Scouts, whose Commandant, both in Sabah and Sarawak, I was.  It resulted from a visit by a Minister from England, formalised by the Director of Borneo Operation, Major General W C Walker, and agreed to by the Inspector General of the Royal Malaysian Police, Dato Sir Claude Fenner.  The first six weeks of my task would take me from Sabah to the Third Division of Sarawak.\n\tAfter all these years, I forget who it was who told me, whilst in the Interior Residency of Sabah, to make a five-day journey into the hinterland, wearing plain clothes and unarmed, posing as a recently-arrived civilian of the North Borneo Trading Company studying the adat, customs, of the Tagal Muruts.  Sixty years later, for the life of me, I cannot believe I would have volunteered for anything so potentially unproductive.  I went with two men, one a Murut himself and the other an Iban from Sarawak who had married locally.\n\tMy Gurkha gunman Tank\u00e9 Limbu, marksman, linguist and friend of many years, lent to me by 1/7 GR, and I started our survey from Jesselton, later known as Kota Kinabalu.  Nine days later, apparently, a cease-fire was signed between Indonesia and Malaysia, after an appeal from the Secretary General of the United Nations.  There was a meeting between the two sides in Bangkok.  Having no radio I only heard about it after hostilities started once more.\n\tI had been given a Borneo-wide code name, Black Prince, that had hurriedly to be changed into Brave Prince when it was realised that a colour is not allowed in nicknames.  It was not a name I would have chosen for myself but I felt it was better than Dirty Rat, Pin Head or some such unedifying soubriquet.  Giving me such was kind as it was thought I could get rescued the more easily if I got into trouble: it was never put to the test.\n\tWe reached the local hub, Pensianggan, where I left my uniform and my rifle with a sub-unit of the Royal Leicestershire Regiment.  I sent Tank\u00e9 with a three-day recce patrol of platoon size.  For my part, I changed into plain clothes \u2013 I wore thongs, a white shirt, khaki slacks and a floppy green hat \u2013 and carried a local umbrella, more as a parasol than as a parapluie.  I was poled upstream in a prahu by the Murut and Iban.  Three hours later we reached a habitation, I thankfully got out of the boat and went up into a house.  Native custom demands strange mouths to be fed and fed we were.  By then it was about 2 o\u2019clock and there was nothing to do until dark.  The locals did not speak Malay and I did not speak Murut, so I sat on the bare floor and made faces at the children.  At dusk I was taken to another house, across the river, for the night.  This was smaller and meaner than the previous one but of the same pattern; on one side of the interior were separate rooms, the remainder being bamboo-slatted floor with, at either end, a raised portion, rather like a small stage.  In the middle was a board on legs on which a continuous supply of the most grisly and putrefying mud and river fish, and meat, monkey or pig I could not tell, on fly-blown plates, was brought by the women of the house.  Next to the board was a bench.  Between that and the board were large pottery jars, knee-high, with dragon motifs, in which was either putrefying rice or tapioca.  Two bamboo \u2018straws\u2019 protruded through a wooden bung and water was poured into the neck of the jar onto the rotting matter inside.  We men folk took turn and turn about at sucking the circulating water through a bamboo \u2018straw\u2019 and at chewing the bits of smelly stuff that were small enough to come through the \u2018straw\u2019.  I, as guest, was invited to sit on the bench, along with the senior inmate, and have my first pick and suck.  Thanks to the dim light of flickering lamps, I went through the motions without much ado.  To see five locals sitting down bending forward sucking away reminded me of so many pigs with their heads in the trough.\n\tThere were also large gongs in this house and they were banged intermittently the whole night.  Singing, rather touchingly in part-song style; riddle-asking and quip-making; dogs yelping when being incessantly clumped because they got in the way; women talking shrilly; pigs, under the house, squealing and grunting; chickens, all round the house, crowing, at various intervals; children crying and shouting, all added to the bedlam.  I lay to one side, some six feet from the gongs and went into a fitful doze, hoping they\u2019d pack it in.  They did, at about 7 o\u2019clock the next morning.  All night!\n\tWe poled and paddled upstream some three to four hours next morning, I walking the difficult parts, and got to a similarly constructed, though bigger, house, after a wash.  I had a meal then a sleep.  I was woken for another meal but feigned a headache.  The inhabitants were just as noisy, all night, as the other house had been.  By the morning I felt jaded.\n\tThe following day we walked through the jungle and up the river until we came to yet another house: thank goodness we had a quiet night, only disturbed by an old man coughing and moaning.  That was our \u2018high-water\u2019 mark.  We then returned, walking back to the boat and spent the night in a house when either dogs barking or a baby crying took over after the gongs and singing had come to a halt.\n\tAnd then it was back to Pensianggan.  I found I could sublimate my feelings on such occasions like those and watch with a patience that those in my childhood my family would have found foreign.  As for Tank\u00e9 Limbu, he fervently told me he wished never to have to experience anything similar again.  He appeared to have been more frightened than I had been.\n\tSo what had I gained by my strange escapade?  Those five days were like no others in my peripatetic Borneo life.  But I had been part of \u2018there\u2019, inhaled the atmosphere, benefitted from the hospitality of the locals and could now the better understand and evaluate certain problems.  One man I spoke to (one of the very few who had a smattering of Malay) thought Confrontation was just a continuation of the Japanese war!  Another had heard of the troubles \u2013 prices too high in the shops, he told me \u2013 but, as far as Indonesian \u2019Confrontasi\u2019 was concerned and so many empire troops out to contain it, not a clue.  I was probably the first European seen wandering around that part of the country since before the start of World War 2: I wonder if any others have gone back?  I somehow doubt it.\n*\nIn the uplands near the border of Sabah and Sarawak next to a large, ice-cold river and very seldom visited by any of the Administration was a remote longhouse.  Missionaries had been to it before Confrontation but when the troubles broke out there was no help even from an alien God.  It was natural, therefore, that efforts from both sides should be made to influence the hapless inmates and that they should react to whichever side maintained the greater pressure.  In due course some British troops were sent to the area and, intent on winning both the hearts and minds of the locals, treated them well.  Biscuits and cast-off clothing ensured a steady contact being maintained.  It was bad luck that one of the visitors who was shown round the camp by a proud platoon commander was an enemy sergeant on a reconnaissance.  When this was realised, feelings were hurt and tension engendered.  Human nature being liable to certain reactions it was not long before equally certain avoidable, and regrettable, restrictions were imposed on the longhouse dwellers.  Thus were the seeds of reprisal sown, as it was done ham-handedly.\n\tShortly afterwards I arrived.  By this time the enemy had arrived from Indonesia, had a battle, lost some men, but pressed on north.  A few of the enemy were believed to be skulking in the rain forest an hour\u2019s walk from the longhouse.  I was asked to walk down to where the headman and one of his henchmen were harvesting their rice crop.  Both men were restricted in their movements and had to get permission from the local military commander before they could move away.\n\tThere was a local Border Scout section living in the house but, due to some mix-up, they not only spoke a different language but also did not understand the local patois.  I took two of these men, plus my Gurkha, on the twenty-minute walk to the harvest area.  A small, stilt-raised platform was where the two men lived and we climbed up and sat on the rickety bamboo floor.  Questions were asked and answers given.  It was general conversation until I began to be questioned closely as to my future movements.  I told them and the two locals immediately put their heads together and, for the first time, started talking in their own patois.  If I felt uneasy, so did Tank\u00e9.  The headman then said he would like to talk with me on the morrow, and he would come to the longhouse that evening to fix the time.  It was then ten in the morning.\n\tWe left.  On the way back Tank\u00e9 said, \u2018Saheb, why did you have to tell them everything?  You know this trip we are on is a two-month one and that we are at a disadvantage as we walk along the border.  You and I cannot afford to get involved in a fight.  I don\u2019t like it at all.\u2019\n\tPrivately I agreed with him.  I told him to ask the Border Scouts how they read the situation, then I would determine what course of action we should take.  By the time the headman had arrived that evening I had had it from three sources that we would be ambushed the following day with the headman or the day after that if I stuck to my proclaimed programme of walking to the next house over the border in Sarawak.  At five that evening the headman came and fixed an appointment for eleven the next morning.  He would not have time to come himself but if I were to go down that jungle track, he pointed in a direction that lay away from the camp and the harvesting, I would meet him near a stream.  Please would I go alone?\n\tHad I been brave, had I not taken counsel of my fears, had I not listened to the advice of others, I would have gone the following morning.  But I did not go.  Instead I waited till 5 o\u2019clock in the morning and, rousing two Border Scouts as guides, told them we were moving at six, across into Sarawak.  As I was packing up, a man came out of a room opposite and joined me on the verandah.  He was a a middle-aged Murut who claimed he had been given a gold medal for helping some American airmen during the Pacific War.  \u2018This is the correct decision,\u2019 he said.  \u2018I will guide you.  He with whom you spoke yesterday is not to be trusted.  He is up to no good.\u2019  It was to this man that I had put my quandary, as a hypothetical question, the previous day.\n\tThere were five of us in the party.  Myself, the Gurkha soldier, the guide and two Border Scouts.  These had already been detailed as guides before the Murut\u2019s kind offer.\n\tEleven hours and maybe twenty miles later we were well out of the known danger area and across in a friendly house in Sarawak.  TheJourney had been tiring but uneventful.  We rested our legs on a raised platform that ran the length of the nine-doored house.  The head man, a young Christian convert, lived, as befitting his status, in the middle room.  When we arrived he was away in the fields, harvesting his rice.  Here was irrigation and rice could be some in the same fields each year.  This was much easier than cutting down the jungle and planting hill rice.\n\tWe went away for a wash in the cold stream, which acted as a tonic.\n\tBack in the house, dressed once more, we both felt very hungry.  Being guests, albeit uninvited, it was against the laws of hospitality to do anything except wait to be invited.  An old crone came from the end room and shyly invited us in for a meal.  I was surprised that the headman had not reappeared but was glad of a chance to assuage my hunger.  She said grace and we uncovered our eyes.  The meal consisted of rice, wrapped in a banana leaf, and a spinach-like vegetable.  It tasted plain but filled us both.  We rose, thanked the woman and left.  As we passed the second door it opened and a young smiling Murut said, \u2018Come and eat in my place.\u2019  I said that we had just eaten but he seemed to think that no reason for not eating again.  So grace was said once more and more rice was offered, as well as a sliver of meat in a watery soup, and vegetables.  It was hard work but Tannk\u00e9and I both made a brave showing and flatulently patted our distended guts as we left.\n\tMy one aim was to sit quietly and digest my two meals but it was not to be.  No sooner were we out of the second door and opposite the third when that, too, opened and yet another invitation was given.  For the third time that evening we shut our eyes and bowed our heads as grace was said.  Food was then offered.  Quite how we managed to do any justice to it, I do not remember, but eventually, belching merrily and feeling gross, we eased ourselves off the mats and, with profuse thanks, left the room.\n\tThe Gurkha said, as we passed the fourth door, \u2018You know, they are very hospitable here, but I am glad we have finished for this evening.\u2019  He had hardly stopped speaking when, to me horror, we were confronted with an open doorway and a polite invitation to come and eat was given.  In vain did I protest.  I was told, firmly and politely, that it was many years since he had had the honour of entertaining a European and how could I refuse his wish?  How could I, I mused, and dejectedly followed him in.  What under normal circumstances would have been a pleasant meal, tasty, served by a pretty young Murut girl, now took on the qualities of a nightmare.  Grace was said for a fourth time.  \u2018Please eat,\u2019 said our host.  The Gurkha giggled feebly and made great efforts to eat something.  I was seized by recklessness unusual in me and, with one eye on the nearest door leading into the darkness, bet myself I could eat ten mouthfuls.  I just managed to and looked around in a torpor.  The Gurkha was emulating me and manfully showing appreciation of this unwanted hospitality.  Once more we hoisted ourselves off the floor.  Once more we took leave and once more, as we passed the fifth, the middle, the headman\u2019s door, it opened and we were invited in for a meal.\n\tIt lay on the floor, lovingly put out by his wife.  Lord knows they were poor, but it was obvious that they had gone to great pains to produce little delicacies they could ill afford.  It was a difficult situation.  I knew that great store was set on proper appreciation of hospitality.  I also knew that they were a proud people and it would do no good to offend.  So I said to the Gurkha, \u2018Tank\u00e9, we must!  Let us go through the motions.  Let him say his thank-you prayers.  let us join in.  After all, eating ourselves to death is less frightening than being ambushed by the opposition.\u2019  We shared a plate of rice.  It was unusual, but so were the circumstances.  The headman joined us as we forlornly pecked at what he had given us.  I hope he understood.  The taut skin of my belly rebelled at being further punished.  I stood up.  \u2018Headman,\u2019 I said.  \u2018Please eat slowly and in peace.  I go and wait outside.\u2019  A distance from the house I put my finger down my throat and, hoping the headman did not hear, vomited.\n\tAll the inhabitants of the longhouse gathered round me when I reappeared out of the darkness.  For four hours they questioned me on all aspects of Confrontation and Malaysia as well as such matters that normally concern the District Officers about which I knew nothing.  It was hard work and at midnight I had to ask their forgivingness as sleep overtook me.  I do not believe that I even finished the sentence.  Someone must have covered me with a blanket, it was three thousand feet above sea level and cold, for I had one round me when I awoke soon after dawn.\n\tAs the people left the house to continue with the harvest, we gave them our heartfelt thanks.  The three from Sabah then returned and the Gurkha and I continued on our long journey, regaled, refreshed, replete \u2013 and safe.\n62***\nStass, meaning \u2018hard wood\u2019 in the Jagoi language, was a small village set a mile back from the frontier, one of those places that lie dormant for a thousand years and then, through the perverse fortunes of fate, famine, earthquake or war, suddenly spring into world headlines.  It would have been termed a nodal point by military thinkers.  It lay on the direct route from Kuching and in 1857 when Chinese rioters fled, then again in 1945 when the Japanese did likewise, they passed through it.  During Confrontation the Security Forces garrisoned the place.  When I visited it there was a Marine presence as well as a mixed Gurkha and Border Scout one.  None of \u2018romantic Borneo\u2019 was to be found here.  No invigorating upland climate, no absurd straw hats or complicated tattoos pricked out over manly, warlike bodies.  Here dwelt the gentler Land Dyak who had been driven there by, from the east, the more ebullient Iban, and who had been harassed from the west by marauding pirates.  But they were kindhearted people and, once shown how, became capable leaders and scouts.  Like so much of Borneo life, real knowledge was at a premium, individual personalities could hold tremendous sway and hearsay was endemic.\n\tAll the houses of the village were built on stilts.  The house I stayed in was a separate entity, and primitive.  We all slept in one room on the floor \u2013 father, mother, elder daughter and a small child.  The house, like the others, had a central room, an off-shoot kitchen and a partitioned room with a door, possibly a bridal suite.  On the walls were the inevitable information posters and, as always, the Queen and Prince Philip.  England was never known as England, always \u2018the Queen\u2019s country\u2019.  Some of the posters were useful.  In the local lingo as well as Malay folk were shown how to grow rice and rubber.  However, of less use, was a highly coloured one of Industrial Motor Vehicles of Great Britain.  As the nearest road head was five hours\u2019 walk away, it was decidedly futuristic.  There was an out-of-date calendar of the Vicariate Apostolic of Kuching and a handless clock.  Toilet arrangements were primitive in the extreme.  Many of the houses were joined together by rickety wooden \u2018paths\u2019 which allowed easy access.  Privacy was negligible.  The raised wooden spaces in front of each house were used for gossiping as well as drying grain, making leaves into thatch and providing play grounds for children.  Fowls scavenged and dogs basked.  All was peaceful, friendly and slightly smelly.  Then an enemy agent gave notice that an attack would be made.\n\tBrutality suddenly erupted.  Refugees started to pour in from both sides of the border with reports that an elderly man working in his fields was seized by Indonesians who had crossed over.  Apparently is clothes were set alight, then dowsed with boiling water.  He was forced to eat a hot coal and was finally beheaded, many hours later.  The Stass villagers became angry and decided to go across the border and show their mettle to the opposition.   They asked me to escort them to the border.  It took two hours to gather twenty militant men.  We moved out from the village confines.  Within five minutes all stopped with one accord.  Jihed, an ex-policeman with considerable experience, showed his intense disgust by firing his shotgun into the bushes.  Suddenly a voice was heard crying from the village, \u2018Return!  Return!\u2019  Gongs, the warning of an enemy attack, were beaten, clangingly metallic.  The effect was instant.  All turned and rushed back to their houses.  Jihed and myself, along with a Gurkha of Border Scouts, stared at one another.  Back in the village, we found it deserted.  All had hidden.  Shamefacedly they emerged when it was realised that the \u2018attack\u2019 was Jihed firing his shot gun.  I assembled the group again and harangued them \u2018Are you chickens, fish, women or men?\u2019  I glowered ferociously.  \u2018Hands up those who will go with me\u2019?  There was a furtive showing, a majority vote.  We tiptoed away towards the border.\n\tNothing constructive was achieved and we all returned to camp that evening where I spent the night, instead of in the village itself.\n63***\nThe settlement of Long Jawi, another remotely situated village near the international border on the Sarawak side, was attacked by a force of about two hundred Indonesians with up to two hundred porters.  There was an eighteen strong Border Scout post, with six Gurkhas as their section commanders and four Police Field Force signallers.  The attackers used mortar fire and medium machine guns.  Two Gurkhas were killed, one wounded and hidden who was eventually rescued and three escaped; two policemen were killed and two escaped; and one Border Scouts was killed, three were wounded and fourteen of them escaped.  In a later engagement it was reported that a further three enemy were wounded.  In a Gurkha follow-up thirty-two Indonesians were killed when the two boats in which they were withdrawing, were ambushed.  There were no survivors.\n64***\nThe only one, small Ukit house, the only one of its kind in Sarawak, is typically story book.  I visited them with three Gurkhas, who had been there before, and our welcome was of the warmest.  Handshakes, arms round shoulders and tuak.  I tried to refuse but the maidens would not take no for an answer.  The way they make you drink the stuff is to sing your praises then, all of a sudden, put the stuff to your lips and forcibly feed you.  I made faces, put my nose in the brew instead of my lips, even tickled the dame as she was manuvering the better to carry out her evil intents, but to no avail.  Some slopped down my front, some into my mouth, but she had her way.  This happened three times!  Biscuits were provided and the great game was to feed you a bit of one and give the remaining bit to another girl or eat it herself.  All this in the most delightfully fresh and platonic way, nor could I get angry, nor have been justified in so being.  We had to make good our escape against their protests.  That night in another Councillor\u2019s longhouse the same form took place: a wash, a general talk, a meal, a briefing and then dancing and singing, then the floor.  Next day we tried to get up to a remote longhouse but were forced back by high water.  We therefore visited houses farther downstream and again I had to deliver my message about the \u2018new look\u2019 Border Scout operating technique I had devised five times, each time observing the correct social form.  The last house appeared unfriendly but we swallowed our pride and stayed there but the children loved me and the ice was quickly broken.  We had a riotous time after that, singing and dancing, playing their flutes and stringed instruments.  I was glad we stayed there because I am sure the people won\u2019t forget us.\n\tNext morning we reached where we could not get the day before.  A four-hour journey, including a mile or so long walk when the boat was hauled up the rapids, arrived at the outpost, four houses, three pagan and one Christian.  After my lecture we had an amazing show of affection.  Dancing, unusual by day, and singing, apparently I was the star turn, then drinking, more forcible feeding, a meal then the lamp-black treatment on our faces as we left.  Our faces were covered, as were most of the girls\u2019 and, as a parting gesture, on our getting it not the boat, the girls followed us and got us soaking wet.  One girl was chucked into the river for her pains.  So we left, downstream a few hours to yet another longhouse where I told them all we were tired.  We were given floor space to sleep on, all hugger mugger, and the last I heard was my British officer assistant\u2019s tape recorder amusing Mrs Headman and her friends three yards away.  Two and a half hours next morning saw us in Belaga and we arrived in Sibu by chopper, at 5 o\u2019clock that evening.\n\tAs Commandant Border Scouts part of my charter to visit longhouses in the border areas of Sarawak and Sabah.\u00a0 In the course of a year I had, virtually, walked the whole inhabited frontier, visiting some places more than once.\n65***\nA classic example of distorted message sending came about when I received a signal to meet Dick Noone at the Brunei airport at a certain times.  I had already fixed to meet up with Dick Noone in Kuching but had unexpectedly been called to Brunei to meet a visiting minister.  Dick was not in my mind when, working hard on my brief, I was given an \u2018immediate\u2019 signal message which read, \u2018From the Inspector General of Police.  For Superintendent Cross.  MEET NO ONE IN BRUNEI AT 1100 HOURS ON TUESDAY.\u2019  That very day!  That very minute!  Something must be very amiss for me to have to hide.  So I didn\u2019t go near the airport and missed Dick who looked everywhere for me.  I justifiably earned a strong rebuke for lack of imagination \u2013 for NO ONE read NOONE.  Dick Noone, a famous anthropologist, was busy in Sabah using bogus Border Scouts on some secret mission and just had to meet me.  But...!\n66***\nI left my Border Scouts job glad no longer to be a policeman because IGPOL had refused my deeply thought-out battle-winning tactics which every Border Scout I spoke to liked and made perfect military sense.  I was delighted because I could go back to the life I liked and the men I understood.  I was exhausted both physically and mentally; of the year and two days I had spent in the job, seven months were spent with one night-stop, two months with two night-stops, with the rest passing through Kuching for one night.  Only once did I spend five nights in one village because I waited for a heli which did not come.\n\tI had come to like the people of Borneo but mistrusted official Malay attitude when maps of Malaysia were published showing Borneo, the bigger area, as smaller than mainland Malaya and vice versa.  This, in fact, was merely a variation of the \u2018Cobbold Commission of Enquiry\u2019 which came from Britain to find out if the Borneo people supported Malaysia or not.  The Malays in the group showed a box to tick if the Borneans didn\u2019t support Malaysia.  Most of them ticked it not realising that that was the box showing that support it they did.\n\tI packed up what little I had, said my farewells and went to Ipoh where my battalion was to be told I was to take command of the Gurkha Independent Parachute Company.  All the soldiers said they were disappointed I would not be in the battalion but that the CO would have bullied me were I to return and had that been so they\u2019d have decapitated him in anger.  \u2018For the third year they are trying to kill you,\u2019 one said, referring to the Temiar escapade and the recent Border Scouts job.\n\tSo, after a recuperative leave in England I came back to learn how to be a parachutist, nearer forty years of age than thirty-nine.  My uncle in England had said that from now on my new motto should be \u2018May all my droppings be soft ones.\u2019\nPENINSULAR MALAYSIA: 1965=1971\n67***\nApart from being the \u2018in\u2013theatre\u2019 parachute force, the Gurkha Independent Parachute Company operated as \u2018special force\u2019 patrols and normal infantry.  We were only allowed over into Indonesian territory for 5000 yards and the order came from the Commanding General personally.  The Indonesian units opposite the Para Company were Commandos, KKO, and parachutists, RPKAD.\n\tThe area of operations was thick, matted jungle, ranging between two and four thousand feet high, with swift mountain streams and deep rivers, beetling precipices and steep hills.  It often rained.  The five-man patrols with which the Para Company operated were, numerically, vastly inferior to the opposition ahead of them, somewhere in the region of being outnumbered by at least one hundred to one.\n\tOne day I took two patrols to an area where 1/2 GR had had a battle not long beforehand.  Our task was to see whether there were any Indons farther to the south.  We were due to be away from base for ten days.  We were choppered in as far as possible, moved together to our target area and then separated to search our own areas for three days and join up on the fourth to go back across the border into Sarawak.\n\tWe were well into the area, moving down a narrow ridge which, unusually, was almost bare of foliage, except, at the limit of vision, where four thin saplings were growing on a piece of ground slightly flatter than the rest of the slope.  We stopped for a breather, sheltering in a small rocky outcrop, a feature not uncommon in those high hills.  I was unusually uneasy, ultra-cautious.  I moved slowly to the edge of the outcrop, not exposing myself and, slowly raising my head, had a good look around.  There was nothing untoward between me and where the ridge dipped again the other side of the four saplings.  All was peaceful, nothing was amiss.  And yet, although I couldn\u2019t put his finger on it, I sensed danger.  Yet all was quiet.  I went up to those four saplings and tugged them one by one, and they all came out of the ground.  I realised they were bivouac poles for the Indon ambush who had wanted to sleep on the flatter ground.  At night, when the ambush was lifted, they could have a covering draped between them and, by day, even when they had grown enough roots to regain their normal appearance, they constituted no impediment to the field of fire or vision.  They were recently cut, so looked fresh and natural.  But, as I soon realised, they were in a rectangle and, as I had not seen them exactly face on, they didn\u2019t immediately appear as such.  Nature does not like straight lines and nature\u2019s pattern had been disturbed.  It alerted us to the area having enemy troops in it, probably not far away.\n\tSo, respecting my hunch, the patrol continued on its journey south but deviated from the ridge itself.  We arrived in our target area a little later than planned but safely.  Before splitting up I gave the other patrol commander the grid reference and time where we were to meet up.  Unfortunately the map was totally inaccurate.  I slipped on a steep rock and bent my rifle so it could only be used as a club.\n\tOn a track we were crossing we came face to face with a civilian who talked a garbled brand of Malay and was obviously very afraid of us.  The news he gave us was not reassuring so we had to act quickly, decisively and boldly if we were to fulfil our mission and withdraw without too much fuss.  A nearby longhouse was said to be harbouring some Indon soldiers and a quick attack and away was called for.  In the event there were no soldiers, only some surprised inmates, chiefly old people, who offered us bananas and groundnuts.  I told them the patrol was moving east and left in that direction but jinked back up a small stream west soon afterwards.\nThe track led us to an open area of thick fern that was in full view of some jungle on its far edge.  We felt horribly exposed.  Something made me look at the bottom of the first tree on the far side and on its far side was a carving made by an Indon sentry who had been ambushing the field of fern and had carved his regiment\u2019s name, RPKAD, and the previous day\u2019s date on the bark.\nBy that evening we had completed three of our four days and it was time to meet up with the second patrol.  Lateral communications were impossible and we found ourselves in the one patch of jungle in a vast prairie-like area full of buffaloes.  Came the time to meet up but no patrol was visible.  It grew later than I wanted and I started to worry.\nOne of my soldiers said \u2018Sabeb, why not make a cuckoo noise with your hands.  It could be that the other patrol is near and waiting for such a call.\u2019\nRemembering that I was the only cuckoo in Malaya so many years before and hoping not to be overheard by a local, I made the noise and ten minutes later the other patrol came into view.\nGreat relief for all of us \u2013 and they had been waiting for my cuckoo call!\nWe quickly made our way north and while I was up a tree making a sketch map of where the 1/2 GR battle had taken place, we heard a Hook helicopter, a Russian-made giant, with a fighter escort away to the east where my patrol might reasonably be expected to have reached.  The Hook made a tremendous din, like a couple of steamrollers dancing.  I came down the tree quicker than I had climbed it and I decided to bug out back to Sarawak as quickly as I could.\nLater we were told that it was the first time a Hook helicopter had been known to come so far north.  Its fighter escort told us it had been a serious attempt to find us \u2013 and me with my bent weapon.\n*\nBack in Malaysia we had a test exercise set us to see if our standard was good enough for the long-term Order of Battle, ORBAT.  For the first time in the history of the British Army eighty of us jumped \u2018simultaneous twenties\u2019 from two aircraft.  The Parachute Jump Officer, a Squadron Leader with thirty years parachuting experience, and the Parachute Jump Instructors, sergeants with twenty, said that if they had not seen that no one needed putting right on pre-flight and in-flight checks they would not have believed it possible.  That was my second epiphany, my first being my Gurkhas working with the Temiar aborigines with no sickness or grumbles in spite of contact hunger.\n68***\nMost unusually, there had been thieving in our lines.  Not only had some of the soldiers had their kit stolen but one of the British officers also.  Cases such as this are always troublesome: call in the local or military police and the unit is almost bound to get a poor reputation.  We as the Gurkha Independent Parachute Company were particularly sensitive on this point; don\u2019t call in any outside help and drifting until a break is made is not good for morale, discipline nor, necessarily, for success.\n\tThe day this was reported to me, a Friday, by the company senior Queen\u2019s Gurkha Officer, Dhanman Gurung, he said that the soldiers were getting so restless so \u2018something had to be done\u2019 and it was obvious that I, the boss, would have to do it.  But what?  I\u2019d let him know what I\u2019d do on the Monday.\n\tThe mess where we British officers lived was staffed by Chinese and Tamils.  If one of the civilian staff were implicated, that would mean two thieves, one operating in the soldiers\u2019 barracks and one in the mess.  The senior Tamil waiter was distressed to think that, after so many years loyal service, even he was under suspicion.\n\tThat Friday evening he sidled up to me after my meal and asked if he could speak about the most recent mess theft that had occurred the day before.  He felt that one man and not a gang was responsible in both the barracks and the mess.  He told me \u2018normal\u2019 methods could not catch the thief but he knew of an \u2018abnormal\u2019 way to help us find out who the miscreant was.\n\tHe knew a Tamil boy who could tell us by writing down where the stolen stuff was.  \u2018Write?\u2019  \u2018Yes, write, not speak.\u2019  All we then needed to do was to go and get it from where we had been told to.\n\tThe idea was certainly a novel one and was worth a try.  It would be interesting to see the boy in action.  Against my inner conviction I agreed.\n\tOn Sunday evening the waiter led the Tamil boy into the mess, with an elder man in train.  The boy was nervous as if unsure of himself \u2013 I could not blame him \u2013 and sat cross-legged on the floor with a writing pad on his lap and a pencil in his hand.  His companion sat in front of him and, crooning softly, put him into a trance.  We British officers understood not a word but we looked on with great interest and not a little skepticism.\n\tMotionless to start with, a while later the boy\u2019s hand went to the writing pad and he started making meaningless lines.  I was too far away to see anything in detail but near enough to know that there was no inspired writing there.  But had I really expected there to be?  The boy\u2019s hand started kinking, making patterns.  By the time he had reached the bottom of the page he was in stress, weaving backwards and forwards, sweating and moaning softly.  His mentor then took him out of his trance and led him away for a cold drink before taking him back to wherever he had come from.\n\tThe mess waiter showed me the piece of paper but I could make nothing of it.  I was disappointed even though I had expected nothing.  But the waiter was excitedly telling me that, among the kinks and squiggles, there indeed was a message, written in Tamil.  \u2018Under the bed, in the room.\u2019\n\tWe officers went back to our rooms, looked under the mattress and felt under the bottom sheet.  Nothing.  How could there be?\n\tAs I told Dhanman about this next morning his eyes lit up.  \u2018Saheb, let\u2019s have a kit check.  Maybe it will be under a soldier\u2019s bed in his kit box.\u2019\n\tAnd, just as the Tamil boy had told us, the wooden box under the bed of one of the batmen contained all the officer\u2019s stolen kit and all that he had lifted from the soldiers.\n\tWhen I charged him I asked him to explain himself.  His answer still intrigues me: \u2018My father was a thief.  Do you expect his son to be any different?\u2019\n69***\nI badly dislocated my shoulder on one jump trying to get clear of one less skilled than he should have been not far from the ground.  My shoulder finished up behind my neck and I pulled it down to below where it normally resided.  I was incapacitated for a long time and threatened by being \u2018boarded\u2019 medically to more sedentary jobs.  One of my Gurkhas brought a village Malay bomo, medicine man, to inspect me, which he did and reckoned that, if I had a clean heart he could cure me.  For five generations he had healed breaks and dislocations, mostly occasioned by coconuts falling onto recumbent figures below.  Eventually he cured me by transferring my pain into a healthy chicken and I was in no way better till the chicken died, which it did in four days.  My Company Sergeant Major\u2019s broken leg took eight months to mend and to be absorbed into the chicken which died; he re-qualified as a parachutist with no trouble and went on to reach the rank of Gurkha Captain.  Another man\u2019s badly bruised rib took only eleven days to mend and for his chicken to succumb.  The specialist who inspected me said he would not have believed such a recovery if he had not seen it with his own eyes.\n70***\nThere were two occasions during my three and a half years commanding the parachutists when non-parachute work occurred.  The first time was when I was phoned from GHQ telling me that I was wanted in Sarawak as an Iban interpreter.  Apparently a grief-stricken mother, Mrs C., in England, hearing of the loss of her marine son on operations had been plagued by dreams that he was still alive and a prisoner in Indonesia.\n\tMrs C. had written to President Sokarno and had a reply that Marine C. was not a prisoner in Indonesian hands.  She had then written to the British Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, who authorised her to go the border village in Sarawak whence her son had gone on the fatal operation and ask the headman if he could let her know the true facts.  This meant her coming to Singapore and, with the Regimental Sergeant Major of her son\u2019s Commando, the senior Red Cross lady and an interpreter, go across to Sarawak.\n\tThere was, however, one major problem; the son had been killed on a cross-border raid and these were still of a Top Secret nature.  The report that had reached Mrs C. was that he had fallen down a steep hill into the river that was the border and his body lost.  In fact there was no hill and no river but a stretch of flat country the other side of a stream.\n\tI wondered how the headman, whom I knew, would react as some British troops based in his village had thrown a grenade into his house, angry at thinking he had told Indonesians about their movement.  The headman knew the level of my Iban was above misinterpreting what he had to say and my intense worry was having to tell the bereaved lady a completely wrong story while hoping against hope that the children who had learnt English and were listening in would not vociferously shout out what the headman had actually said, so contradicting me, to the lady\u2019s intense grief.\n\tWe flew over to Kuching where I was delighted to meet John Baggely, my one-time Border Scout staff officer and now working in the Health Department.  His Iban was so much better than mine I cajoled him to come and help out.  We made our way to the village and introductions were made.  John told the headman who we were and why we had come to his house.\n\tThe headman turned to the bereft mother, still full of hope, and the expression on his face told her all.  She broke down in tears and Jessie de Lotz, the Red Cross lady, comforted her.  I made my way to where the Border Scouts\u2019 camp was and, to their delight \u2013 \u2018you were the only one who spoke to us in Iban\u2019 \u2013 had a chat with them.\n\tWe went back to Kuching, where the consul, one Don Dunford, a friend from my days in the 1 GR Regimental Centre, put us up for the night before flying to Singapore on the morrow.  As we parted the marine\u2019s mother came over to me to bid me farewell.  She smiled and said, \u2018Thank you.  You made it easy for me.  You made me laugh.\u2019\n71***\nThe other occasion also had its moments: I was again phoned from GHQ telling me that I was wanted to meet someone.  \u2018Next Thursday.  Come in plain clothes.  Go behind the main building to a gate in a wire barrier and ring the bell.  Do not forget your identity card.  Be there at exactly half past 11.\u2019\n\tI was mystified.  It was only going down Orchard Road that the most torrential rain storm cause a flash flood and a large vehicle in front of me broke down blocking the entire road...and I was late.\n\tI found the bell, rang it and a man approached.  He held his hand out for my ID card, unlocked the gate, let me in and locked up.  Saying nothing he beckoned me to follow him to another gate where a similar transfer took place.  I was taken to a door that did not have a handle, a bell was rung, a Judas window opened, an eye surveyed me and I let in.  We went to an office door, my escort knocked and I was let in.\n\tA middle-aged man at a desk and snapped \u2018You\u2019re late,\u2019 looking at his watch.  Another man sat in a reclining chair to one side.  Both wore plain clothes.\n\tI apologised, telling them why.\n\t\u2018We\u2019re behind time.  I will be brief,\u2019 the man sitting behind the desk began abruptly.  \u2018All our operatives are dead or incapacitated.  The Colonel\u2019 \u2013 indicating man sitting in the chair \u2013 \u2018has come from London to enlist your help as it seems you are the only one in the army who fits the requirement.  To start with it will be for six months.  There is an even chance that you will come back alive but you're needed.\u2019  He paused and I asked him about the job.  He was vague, training people somewhere.\n\tI told him I would have to ask the General if I could be spared and could not give him an answer till the Monday.  The Colonel gave me his phone number and reluctantly allowed the delay, hoping, almost pleadingly, I could say \u2018yes\u2019.\n\tIt was the time of a major contraction of the Gurkhas and the General wanted me to stay where I was and, as there was no promotion in the job with the possibility of death, he advised me to say \u2018no\u2019.\n\t\u2018General,\u2019 I said, \u2018that\u2019s probably the best advice you could ever give me.\u2019\n\tWhen I phoned the Colonel he sounded more than disappointed, rather as if those looking for a new Dalai Lama he now had to look elsewhere \u2013 but for the Colonel there was no elsewhere as no army other army officer was ever approached.\n72***\nIt was the time of the Indonesian incursion into Sarawak in 1966 which came to be known as the \u2018Sumbi Saga\u2019.  Many rumours had reached the authorities about this Indonesian Lieutenant Sumbi who was believed to be about to undertake a dangerous mission for his country.  Apart from any other training he had had in his own army, he had learnt to parachute in Abingdon in England and had been taught his basic jungle tactics at the JWS.  It was thought that the plot was for Sumbi to lead a band of some fifty soldiers from Kalimantan Utara, as Indonesian Borneo is known, infiltrating through Sarawak to Brunei and then to sabotage the Shell oil installations while the Malaysia-Indonesia Peace Talks were being held in Bangkok \u2013 trying to patch up the latter\u2019s \u2018Confrontation\u2019 of the former \u2013 so lulling people into a feeling of false security with their eyes turned towards mainland Asia instead of keeping watch and ward on Borneo island.\n\tWhen the incursion eventually started it came from across the border in the mountainous area of the Fourth Division of Sarawak.  It was Sumbi\u2019s bad luck that the border crossing was made through a sector patrolled by the Gurkha Independent Parachute Company.  A couple of ace operators, Corporal Singabahadur Gurung, from 1/6 GR, and Rifleman Dharmalal Rai, from 1/10 GR, were patrolling when Dharm\u00e9 noticed a tiny glint, unnaturally bright, among the leaves on the jungle floor.  He examined it and found it was a piece of tinfoil which smelt of coffee.  Gurkhas didn\u2019t have coffee in their rations and there were no British troops in the area so, he reasoned, it had to be Indons, yet there were no obvious traces of them.\n\tThe two soldiers then remade contact with their three other patrol members and, casting around, eventually met and tracked what they could dimly discern as jungle boot prints for three men and some suspicious signs where a branch, used as a brush, had swept at the foliage.  Why suspicious?  Two reasons: one was because some of the vegetation was lying unnaturally and, secondly, since the patrol knew it was not they who had made those tracks, trying to hide only three men\u2019s tracks was the sign of trespassing.\n\tThe patrol, working under command of 1/7 GR, followed this vague trail for the rest of the day and the next, neither cooking nor making camp that night.  This, in the cold Borneo Uplands, was a feat of discipline in itself.  They then discovered a pile of strips of sacking with which Sumbi\u2019s men had wrapped their feet, thus leaving no footprints, and the three pairs of British pattern jungle boots that had been worn by the last men, now discarded; there were also other signs that confirmed numbers in the group, direction taken and how long ago they had moved off.  The patrol then handed over their quest to 1/7 GR and back-tracked the incursors to the border, thereby allaying Higher Command\u2019s fears of a wrong interpretation being made of the findings so far.  It was all superbly good jungle craft.\n\tDuring the next month or so all hell was let loose, as far as Sumbi and his men were concerned.  Some of his men were captured, some died of starvation and some were killed.  Interrogators flew over from Singapore so that the captives could tell their story while it was still fresh in their minds and they were more receptive to treatment.  Sumbi himself was eventually captured by a small group amongst whom were a British Major, later awarded an Military Cross, and a Queen\u2019s Gurkha Officer, who became riled when he learnt that Sumbi had earned a \u2018B\u2019 grading on the jungle warfare course whereas his had only been a \u2018C\u2019.\n\tEventually all less four of the group of would-be saboteurs had been accounted for.  As a political sop or as a friendly gesture all operations in Malaysia were then suspended while the Peace Talks were conducted.  That didn\u2019t prevent patrols of the Para Company from being committed just inside Brunei even though, in the thousands of square miles of jungle available for hiding in, the chances of contacting four men were very remote indeed as there were no clues to indicate that they had got anywhere near, let alone reached, Brunei.  One of the patrols near the border was led by Corporal Chandrabahadur Rai, 1/7 GR, and one of his men, Jamansing Rai, had to be evacuated by helicopter.  Reinforcement was needed and I, having little else to do, flew in to take the sick soldier\u2019s place.  The very next day, patrolling a mile or so from the Brunei-Sarawak border, the last men of the patrol saw a leaf on the ground.  He saw it had a straight crease across it.  Only a man could have folded it in half.  It was not being looked for, how could it have been? but the pattern of nature had been disturbed.  It was common knowledge that none of the Security Forces had been in the area for a long time so who else could it be but for one of the four men the patrol was looking for?  It had rained the night before and, by then, the four men were superb at covering their tracks so till then the leaf was the only clue there was.  The search in the area was intensified and we saw faint traces of four men.  We followed them into the area of the Royal Brunei Malay Regiment.   A day or so later the four men went into a local\u2019s house asking for food.  The local cycled to the nearest Police Post and passed the news on.  They were apprehended later that day.\nDuring the subsequent and exhaustive interrogation carried out, it transpired that one of them was a compulsive finger-twiddler, a doodler one might say, who, for much of the time, had a twig or a leaf in his hand.  Every time a man disturbs something, the pattern of nature is broken.  So that was the end of the \u2018Sumbi Saga\u2019 and the end of the threat to the Brunei oil installations.\n\tI felt strongly that Gurkhas\u2019 skill had to be recognised so I asked that the Director of Borneo Operations, a Major General, come over from his HQ on Labuan island to the Para Company camp so that he could personally congratulate Singabahadur and Dharmalal.  The Times newspaper of Wednesday, 7 December, 1966, observed that what those two had done was \u2018one of the most brilliant actions in the history of Gurkhas\u2019.  It\u2019s strange to think that such a bold adventure should have been thwarted, initially, by a piece of tinfoil and that just one leaf should have ended it.\u2019\n\tI have lectured young officers since 1998 and stress that if a soldier does not get any award he is put in for, to present him to the next VIP who visits their camp.  I tell them how, in 1980, I asked the Prince of Wales to congratulate two Gurkha officers for whom I could get no other recognition, and likewise in 2016 when Prince Harry visited the Gurkha camp.\n73***\nIn my first thirty years of service I spent ten of them in the jungle: in Burma against the Japanese; in Cochin-China, now Vietnam, with the Yamagishi Butai against the Vietcong; in Malaya against the guerrillas; and in Borneo against the Indonesian Army.  I had a price pit on my head twice, once in Borneo and once in Vietnam.  I was announced as dead by Radio Pontianak in Indonesian Borneo; I was published as dead in the Sarawak Gazette, which I read; and by word of mouth in England.  Between the ages of eighteen and fifty-one there were only three years I did not carry a weapon on one operation or another or was escorted by armed men in Thailand, Laos and Vietnam.  If the hunter leaves an obvious footprint the only result will probably be a missed contact; if the hunted does it probably means death or capture.  I know because I have been both.\n\tBut I am still alive because when I moved I never cut that which I could bend naturally, I never bent naturally that which I could move, I never moved that which I could get under by not moving, I never trod on that which I could step over and I never trod on soft ground when I could tread on hard.  Where necessary I trod in water and got my feet wet and where necessary I walked backwards.  I never did anything needlessly.\n\tWhen I was with my troops none was wounded or killed.\n\tA statistic from World War 2 shoes a stark difference: in 1944 XXXIII Corps was 88,500 strong.  There were 50,300 total casualties of whom only 49 were killed in action.  Ill-health casualties out-numbered battle wounds by more than 50 to 1.  The Irish Guards say \u2018The ancient days come back no more/Than water under the bridge,/But the bridge still stands and the water runs,/As red as yesterday.\u2019\n\tAs a soldier with forty years of experience I have often been asked to comment on wars in Afghanistan, Ukraine and Gaza.  I never found my answers convincing as all fighting is so totally different in so many ways yet have so many common aspects.  I somehow doubt I\u2019d have been all that successful in such conflicts, especially in a Gurkha battalion when I would have found coping with deaths of those I had known as comrades=in-arms all my military life more than most difficult, even though \u2018needs be...\u2019.\nLANGUAGES\n74***\nI had already tackled one tonal language, Cantonese before I took over command of the JWS but had not had time to learn the characters.  As we had all-Thai and all-ARVN courses I determined to learn both languages.  For Thai I started using its script, not a Romanised version.  An all-Thai course was due to start in six months\u2019 time and I decided to give my opening address in Thai.  My tutor was a Thai national of Chinese origin who lived in Singapore.  He had bad halitosis but as I was his only student I could avoid the worse wafts and could go at my own pace.\n\tBefore the course started I passed a British Army Thai oral examination.  I gave an eleven-minute welcome and worked out that, including travelling time, one hour\u2019s preparation had been needed for one minute\u2019s delivery.  My instructor had warned me that my audience would not react to my formal speech and, to see if they had understood, I was to add one sentence as if it were an afterthought.  If there was a positive reaction I would know I had been understood.  Although a trifle risqu\u00e9 I concluded: \u2018Oh, there is one more point.  The women in Singapore are old and expensive.\u2019  Yes, they had understood me but, for two days after the opening address, I had a complete mental blockage in Thai.\n\tTeaching myself the Thai script, with the aid of children\u2019s copy books found in Bangkok, took a long time.  Thai words are all joined together and, depending on where letters appear in a word, they change, sometimes only from, say, \u2018t\u2019 to \u2018d\u2019, or \u2018s; to \u2018n\u2019 but, at others, for instances, a double \u2018r\u2019 can be either \u2018nr\u2019, a long \u2018a\u2019 or even \u2018anr\u2019.  A break in the writing only comes at the end of a sentence or after each word in a list of words.  I devised a method of writing that was a type of music.  With three \u2018pitches\u2019 \u2013 high, medium and low \u2013 and with three tones \u2013 level, rising and falling \u2013 there were nine possible \u2018noises\u2019.  I obligated one colour for each noise, thereby needing nine colours in all.  However, Bangkok Thai has only five so initially I only needed five colours.  I chose red for high level, brown for high falling, green for middle level, blue for low level and black for low rising.  I could now easily see where syllables started and ended, could adjust my voice accordingly and avoid mistakes in deciphering the letters.  Eventually I could read printed Thai using the correct tones.\n\tI used small white memory cards for every word I listed in my master vocabulary which I had already preselected, a mere one thousand and fifty-six of them.  I rewrote my Cantonese vocabulary on blue memory cards using the same colour code.  A year later I started on Vietnamese.  I had to scrounge material, later making my own tapes and, having got hold of a grammar, I invited three Vietnamese students to my room.  I had asked one northerner from Hanoi, one man from the central city of Hu\u00e9 and one southerner from Saigon, all of whom spoke in different tones.  Incidentally, Vietnamese has been adjudged as one of the hardest languages in the world, as there are not only the tones, but there are four \u2018contours\u2019 of speech, from the normal, staid speech of the unhurried to the shrillness of the impassioned and the tone of almost every word, from the bottom \u2018contour\u2019 changes as it ascends through the second and third \u2018contour\u2019, to the fourth.  I obviously had to start on the lowest \u2018contour\u2019.  I got my three helpers to repeat the six northern, five central and five southern tones while I kept my eyes shut, comparing them with the colour code.  After five minutes I \u2018had\u2019 all the tones and opted for the Hanoi dialect as it is crisper, by far, than the mushy south and more common than that of Hu\u00e9.  I used green memory cards for Vietnamese and later grey for Lao.\n\tThe clue to keep these tonal languages separate was to remember the colour of the memory cards and the clue for the tones was the obligated colours for them all.\n*\nI had an amusing time listening to the interpreters.  During one lecture the British instructor had a diagram shone onto a screen.  Using the pointer to explain it to the students, he said, \u2018Watch while I go through it.\u2019  The frisson of excitement that ensued not matched by any roll of drums when the Thai interpreter had to correct \u2018going through it\u2019 from diving through the screen to explaining the point he had just made!  Another lecture was about Code of Conduct when a Prisoner of War: \u2018there will be a restriction of mail,\u2019 was translated as \u2018you won\u2019t be allowed many women.\u2019  A tactics lecture talked about a \u2018mortar base plate\u2019 which came over, after careful consideration, as \u2018garage\u2019.\n\tThe one point I now remember for the Vietnamese interpreter was that root ginger did not cure \u2019dysentery\u2019 as he had said but \u2018diarrhoea.\u2019\n*\nI was reminded of one young and pompous officer who, recently married, said that he took his wife once a month to the beach at Port Dickson to give her \u2018a little sun and air\u2019 and took umbrage when I asked, \u2018What, only once a month?\u2019  Puns have no place in most Asian languages I know and can be frowned on in English.  Once when walking outside the Royal Institute for Asian Affairs I was told that the Turkish embassy was nearby and that the Kurds would block the road.  \u2018What,\u2019 I queried, \u2018Kurds and no whey?\u2019\n*\n\u2018Never hobnob with the bumpkins\u2019 the Nationalist Chinese General who lived squalidly in a small village in the New Territories stiffly warned me after I had asked him to confirm what I had heard from a Chinese I had asked what was the correct classifier for a \u2018sports ground running track\u2019.  He then said, sighing sadly, \u2018English is bottomless.\u2019  Yes, \u2018the cow was dogged and the dog was cowed\u2019; \u2018that new display can recognise speech, that nudist play wrecks a quiet beach\u2019; \u2018his pants were in the vestry but his vest was in the pantry.\u2019  As for that classic English absurdity, \u2018now then, come on let\u2019s go\u2019: try it the other way round.  The General\u2019s sigh was genuine!\n*\nIndians have picturesque English: \u2018tantamounting to hullaballoos\u2019 was one I particularly like, another is \u2018spats and hats\u2019 or \u2018boots and suits\u2019 as suitable wear.  And the man who is supposed to have boasted that he had two houses in England: one in Northampton for the summer and the other in Southampton for the winter.  The Indian station master at the wayside station in Rompin, in the Malaysian state of Negri Sembilan, once asked me to show him \u2018photo of sweetheart\u2019.  I told him I did not carry one as it might take my mind off my soldierly duties.  \u2018You are thinking highly and deeply,\u2019 he said.  Then to explain himself, he added, \u2018when I say \u2018highly\u2019 I mean... \u2018highly\u2019 and when I say \u2018deeply\u2019 I mean... \u2018deeply\u2019, isn\u2019t it.\u2019  And I supposed it was. \n\tI particularly like the answer to a question posed by an Englishman who was visiting the subcontinent for the first time.  He went to the main railway station in Calcutta at night and saw many people fully shrouded with thin white cloth lying everywhere.\n\t\u2018Are those people all dead?\u2019 he asked, with a quaver in his voice.\n\t\u2018No,\u2019 his Indian guide assured him, \u2018only very seriously asleep.\u2019\n*\nIn Kathmandu there is a garden place that catered for tourists.  One morning Buddhiman and I sat down and a young hill Nepali asked what we wanted.  He started to talk with me and others gathered around, leaving the rest of the tourists without any waiters.  After a particularly laugh-making comment from me one of the lads said that I spoke almost as well as J P Cross at the university where I was working at the time.\nI said \u2018is he still alive?  I thought he had disappeared a long time ago...\u2019 to the utter bewilderment of my questioner.  I had turned away so he could not see I was laughing but the others saw me and joined in the fun.  The lad's face was a picture when he discovered who in fact I was.  By then the tourists were demanding service so our little party broke up.  Inside were two other lads who had heard the merriment outside and they told me that their soldier fathers had known me and spoken of me since their army days.\nTo my embarrassment I have heard similar remarks from Chinese and Malays not knowing who I was.\n*\nIn pre-war China my friend\u2019s future father-in-law was a Christian missionary with a good knowledge of spoken Chinese.  One day he and a fried went for a country walk and passed some farmers working in their fields.  The missionary said that they looked like So-and-Sos and he could speak some of their language.  So saying he went over and tried to engage them in conversation.  However hard he tried there was no result to he rejoined his friend, saying perhaps he had made a mistake.\n\tAs the two men walked off the missionary heard one farmer say to another that he had understood every word spoken by the foreigner but as the speaker was not Chinese he obviously did not know what he was saying.\nNEPAL: 1966\n75***\nI went on a short trek to Nepal when the Gurkha Para Company was back resting in Kluang in Peninsular Malaysia.  It was the first time I had had a chance to do since my 1947 visit.  I wore white canvas shoes and went bare-headed.  I did not understand why people, normally so friendly, avoided me until it was pointed out that wearing anything white of feet or head and going without a headdress were signs of one in mourning.\n*\nWhen I came to read the notes I had made daily the ink had so faded that I could not read them so, instead I wrotea short piece for our Brigade journal which I reproduce here;\nTHOUGHT\nThey came to the inn at dusk, three tired and foot-sore men.  It was cold and the strong wind was like ice.  They had been on the road for a month, so were used to long and hard walks.  They had, that day, walked since dawn.  Now they searched for a place to spend the night.  Of the three, two knew the road well, but the third man did not as he was new to the place, on trek for the first time.  They were firm friends and could all speak the same tongue.  This was a great help.  The third man had, at times, feigned that he could not speak with men he met on the road.  This, too, had been of use.\n\tThe inn was small and not much more than a large hut, but it had mud walls and a thatch roof and looked, to the tired men, snug.  It stood by the side of the track and was there for those whose need was food, drink and rest: at a price.  At the door they stopped and asked the man of the house if they could buy drink and a meal as well as have a place to spend the night.  He bade them come in and in they went.  It was dark in the one room and full of smoke so, for a while, it was hard to see.  At least it was warm and a change from the ice-cold wind.  The men took off their hats, coats and shoes and groped their way to the wall where they sat and eased their legs.  The man\u2019s wife came from the one small room at the back and sought their needs.  They asked for rice-wine and tea, each to his own taste, and a meal for all three.  Drink was brought and with slow sips they soon felt warm once more.  The man of the house then joined them.  His talk was coarse, his voice was harsh and he coughed and coughed.  He was a loud-mouthed man and looked none too clean.  His wife, though plump, was ill-kempt and kept her two small boys at bay with sweeps of her arm while she cooked, brewed and stirred at the fire-place, which was made of three large stones set in the floor.  Both small boys were in rags and looked ill.  They wept as if they were cold and had scant love shown them.  The son and heir, a youth of a score or so years, had been lame since he was a few month's old.  He had learnt to walk, with the aid of a stick, when he was nine so was not much use at all, but he could do some odd jobs in the house and in the fields as well, or so he said.  He had cut his right hand with a sharp knife that same day when he had gone out to get some food for the goats.  He had tried to reach some grass high on a bank by the side of the road.  The cut was deep and he had lost some blood, so he would be of no use for a few days as the wound throbbed and hurt when he tried to use his hand.\n\tIt was the grown-up girl who seemed to do the most work.  She went to the well, she cut the wood for the fire, she fetched plates, pots and pans.  She then cleaned, wiped and stacked them.  And all with such poise, grace and ease, and so calm!  With no word said, with no haste yet with due speed she did more work than all the rest of her folk.  It was her face that was so sweet, so full of charm, bright yet coy, that drew men\u2019s eyes to her eyes which knew her to be pure.  The man who did not know the road glanced at her, more than once, and at last she met his gaze.  Both smiled and her eyes dropped.  He tried to talk with her but she took no heed and went on with her chores.  Strange, he mused.  In this place where all seem to be ill-starred what quirk of fate has sired so fair and sweet a girl from what looks like dross?  Give her a chance to get clean, dress her with good taste and she would have no par here nor far nor wide.  In that she does not talk to me just shows that she is shy and that she knows her place.\n\tThe meal had, by this time, been set in front of them, on the floor where they sat.  They rinsed their hands then ate the rice, pulse and bean that had been cooked for them.  Mats and rugs were then brought out and they all lay down for the night on the hard floor, full, warm and in need of a good night's rest.  They talked a while, then, wrapped in their own thoughts, shut their eyes and slept.\n\tAt dawn the tree men rose, drank tea, packed up for a new day on the road, paid their dues and left.  There was thick hoar-frost on the ground but the wind had dropped and the sky was a rich, deep blue.  As they left those of the house came to see them off.  The girl was not there.  They saw her at work in the back room and she glanced up and met their gaze.  Once more she smiled but said no word, though she joined her hands in front of her and bowed her head.  She then went on with her work.\n\tOn the road no one spoke for a while then the third man asked his two friends why it was that the girl did not talk, worked so hard and yet seemed so calm?  \u2018Oh, we thought you knew,\u2019 they said, \u2018she has been deaf and dumb from birth.\u2019\nWORD\nIt was the Stranger\u2019s first visit to the Hills.  He had served for over twenty years in one or other of the regiments whose ranks are filled with men from these same hills and he could speak their language well, besides knowing about their customs in some detail, yet he wondered if all his knowledge was enough to do justice to his visit.  On the way up to a village where he was going to meet one already on pension, he was elated by the crisp, clear and almost heady air as opposed to the muggy, clammy, stuffy atmosphere of places nearer the equator.  The long views up to the snows thrilled him as did the sudden, sharp-edged sky-lines met with as a corner was turned or an incline mounted, all so excitingly different.  Certain scenes etched themselves on his mind as he journeyed north: the staggering loads carried alike by man, woman and child, who in bare feet and unharmed by sharp stones, walked with shuffling gait as they picked their way with unhurried speed over the rougher patches.  Then there was the small boy, no more than six years old, holding a sapling branch that would have merely tickled any tough-skinned dog.  The boy was trying to urge on a large and cumbersome buffalo by swipes of the stick, shrieking shrilly, and probably vilely, as he did.  The buffalo, unperturbed, turned its head slowly, almost gently and gazed momentarily at its minute oppressor then plodded on, entirely of its own volition, but with the small boy triumphant.  The houses, also, coloured red and white, looking spick-and -span on the hill-sides were, from afar, a picture.  Nearer by the poverty, the improvisation and, above all, the industry of the people struck him forcibly.  He was fascinated by the row after row of terraced fields, draping the hills now shorn of all foliage and the product of who knows how much sweat, toil and back-ache?   And other things caught his eye and fascinated him: the long scar of a recent land-slide; the kites, soaring so lazily in the currents of air with never so much as a flap of a wing, dropping with so sudden a rush onto some unsuspecting fluff of a chick below.  There were sadnesses too.  A dog dying by the side of the track with grubby-nosed children playing heedlessly around; the coarse-voiced lunatic, chained to the post of a cow shed, stark naked except for his hat; and in another place a cow suffering from a broken leg with a jagged wound unhealed.  But, of course, there were also happinesses.  Three small girls so sweetly singing as they gathered fire wood in the still evening high up on the hillside; the small, highly-coloured birds playing hide-and-seek in a clump of bamboo and, above all, the infectious smile and laughing responses both men and women gave as the Stranger past them.\n\tHe reached the village on the evening of the third day.  The last half mile was steep and he followed some of the villagers who were carrying large loads of straw from an outlying field.  Only strong, firm legs were visible under each load, so it was impossible to tell who was who from behind.  At a stone resting place just short of the village the bales started putting themselves on the ledge set at knee height and, in so doing, turned into dusty and tired men who, relieved of their burdens, stood erect, wiping the sweat and dust from their faces.  They stared at the Stranger and asked him whom he sought and where he was going.\n\t\"I am on my way to meet one Bhimraj who lives in the village called Cloves, which I believe lies yonder,\" was the answer and a gleam of understanding flicked in their eyes.\n\t\"Follow us, you are expected,\" said one of them and, rested, burdens were once more picked up.  The Stranger followed them up into the village now growing obscure in the gathering dusk.  The village was a thick cluster of houses, separated by narrow, winding lanes and each with its own forecourt.  By the time they reached Bhimraj\u2019s house, it was dark.\n\tIt was a happy reunion for they had served together for some time and the Stranger counted himself Friend.  Mat and rug were set down and there the Stranger (for it was all rather strange) sat and waited until the excitement had subsided.  Then, one by one, mother, father, wife, sons, daughters and all and all were introduced.\n\tOutside it became cold and brilliant stars pierced a jet black night but inside the house it was warm and cheerful.  As news of a visitor spread a number of people came to see if they knew who he was or if, by any chance, news of an old friend could be given.  Soon the room was full and there was a lot of laughter as conversation flowed to and fro.  Shadows from two flickering lamps lit up strong, animated faces, all smiling and bright of eye.  In the background, apart from all normal household knick-knacks, stood a row of large ewers.  It was explained that they were used only at marriages when many guests were fed and much water was needed to cook for so many.  The Stranger found that everybody was delighted to impart such knowledge to him and he looked forward to the next day when it would be light enough to see it all.  After a lot more talk he was shown to a small room above a cattle shed where a bed and blankets had been made ready.  After his long walk he was tired and very soon fell fast asleep.\n\tThe next day, early, the Stranger and Bhimraj went to the village spring for their morning wash.  One flow of water was for the men and one for the women.  They, with shy glances at first, but with full face later, bravely spoke and even japed with the two friends.  It all augured well for a happy stay.  Later on, after a meal, the two men wandered around the village, followed by a crowd of curious but very friendly children.  They met all of note; dignitaries, old soldiers, their families and many who were of lesser importance.  But kindliness was ever present because at all the houses they visited the unbreakable laws of hospitality had to be observed; a little food, a little drink, politenesses and then more normal conversation.  It all took time so it was late in the day when they returned to Bhimraj\u2019s house, with full heart and fuller belly.  A short rest and then the evening meal.  If I don\u2019t start walking soon, thought the Stranger, I\u2019ll burst.\n\tThat night many of the villagers assembled in the house and an impromptu sing-song was started:\n\t\u2018I was due back from leave on the twenty-first\n\t\u2018It is now the twenty-fourth\n\t\u2018And because of you my darling\n\t\u2018The Colonel will be wrath.\u2019\nThe woman\u2019s answer was:\n\t\u2018Take me if you\u2019re going to\n\t\u2018When you go tomorrow\n\t\u2018If you don\u2019t I\u2019ll kill myself\n\t\u2018To everybody\u2019s sorrow.\u2019\nAnd the soldier sings:\n\t\u2018My darling says she\u2019ll go with me\n\tWhatever else I urge.\n\tBut I have not brought a family pass\n\tThey\u2019re bound to start a purge.\u2019\nThe chorus, sung between every verse, was:\n\t\u2018Oh stay you here and make no fuss\n\t\u2018On service I\u2019ll not marry.\n\tIn one year\u2019s time I\u2019ll be right back\n\t\u2018To fetch you I'\u2019ll not tarry.\u2019\n\tAn old soldier leaned across to the Stranger and told him that he had been almost stone-deaf for sixteen years and what were they singing?  So the song was explained and the Stranger added, \u2018You may be deaf, but your hands and feet are still strong,\u2019 for he had seen the old man at work earlier in the day.\n\tThis was taken as an invitation to get up and join in, so, the old soldier stood up and, in rumbustious style but creaking joints and panting voice, sang:\n\t\u2018Oh go my darling fry the fish\n\t\u2018And make a wholesome curry.\n\t\u2018Or otherwise I\u2019ll miss my train\n\t\u2018You'll really have to hurry.\u2019\n\tThere were shrills of delighted laughter as the old man had been known as a \u2018regular card\u2019 in his younger days and all were delighted to see him performing once more.  He continued:\n\t\u2018A jet black goat with good crisp meat\n\t\u2018And we\u2019ll all eat a part.\n\t\u2018Yet a woman with looks however sweet\n\t\u2018Must have a golden heart.\u2019\nand after a pause:\n\t\u2018Pure gold needs no touchstone\n\t\u2018And a good man\u2019s heart is pure.\n\tA\u2019nd if only I could raise a loan\n\t\u2018I\u2019d marry that girl for sure.\u2019\n\t\u2018Sit down, old man,\u2019 said the Stranger.  \u2018You're short of breath.  Save what's left for later on.\u2019  And even as he finished talking he realised that it was his turn next, that the others were telling him that he and the deaf man must take it in turns.  So the Stranger got stiffly to his feet and, clearing his throat a little nervously, sang:\n\t\u2018To the village of cloves high on the hill\n\t\u2018An English stranger came.\n\t\u2018One night a deaf old man and he\n\tDanced and sang with great acclaim.\n\t\u2018On his arrival in the place\n\tOf fluttering hand and smiling face\n\t\u2018With flowered garlands, as of lace,\n\t\u2018The maidens comely, one by one,\n\t\u2018Gave him a welcome \u2013 then were gone.\u2019\n\tOf course a second verse was requested and, after due deliberation, it came:\n\t\u2018It was in the jungle that we heard them\n\t\u2018Then we saw the bandit camp.\n\t\u2018I fired a round but my rifle jammed\n\t\u2018And away they all did scamp\n\t\u2018And I realised to my sorrow\n\t\u2018That my gun had played me tricks\n\t\u2018Just like the type of woman\n\t\u2018Who leaves one in a fix.\u2019\n\tIt was straining it to add a third verse, but it was inevitable.  So the Stranger let the chorus be sung several times while he forced himself to think.  And this was the result:\n\t\u2018Some have to stay and farm the land\n\t\u2018While others\u2019 fate it is to roam.\n\t\u2018The life you lead is in your hand\n\t\u2018If in the Regiment or at home.\n\t\u2018Despite the way of life you choose\n\t\u2018One thing only can you trust.\n\t\u2018There\u2019s one command you can\u2019t refuse\n\t\u2018And when you\u2019re called, then go you must.\u2019\n\tThe Stranger was bidding farewell to the people of the Village of Cloves a few days later.  As an expression of friendship he was escorted by about fifty people to the village limits, old and young, hale and lame, man, woman and child.  Eight garlands had been hung around his neck and many nice things had been said.  But none struck nicer than the woman who gave him a hat to wear, saying, \"You talk like us and you sing like us, we see you as one of us.  Never let it be said that a friend of us all in the Village of Cloves left like a man suffering a bereavement - hatless.  We have enjoyed your staying with us.  You are ever welcome to return.\"\nDEED\nOn his way south the Stranger went to spend a few short days with a soldier who was finishing his leave.  This had been easy to arrange as the two men were serving in the same regiment and they had previously decided to return together.\n\tIn the soldier\u2019s home lived widowed mother, unwed sister, young wife and small son.  There was also a younger brother and a small black dog.  The house, made of stone, had a thatch roof, an upper story and boasted a separate kitchen.  It was daubed dull red on the outside.  Being set on the edge of a main track, there was a constant stream of folk passing both ways, often stopping and asking for floor space to spend the night as it was known over a wide area as being a hospitable house.  The soldier\u2019s mother was of uncertain years and even more uncertain temper but she nursed her year-old grandson with obvious devotion.  He, poor mite, was puny and querulous.  His mother did all the work in the house.  The night the Stranger arrived, the village maidens came to sing their welcome.  They all sat outside under a bright moon and sang, a drum beat helping to keep the rhythm.  Their strong, young voices, the slow, haunting melody with its repetitive chant and warmth of message, all so unusual, made a great impression on the Stranger who sat, a little apart, head bowed, untroubled by a cold wind.  Later the tempo quickened and all joined in, singing and dancing, till well into the night.\n\tAll too soon came the day when both soldier and Stranger had to leave; the former son, father, husband and brother; the latter, by now, a friend.\n\t\u2018Look after my son,\u2019 the mother was saying to the Stranger as final preparations for leaving were being made.  \u2018I have never spared myself for him since his father died many years ago.  I have worked myself thin to provide for him and he has never gone hungry nor have I ever been in debt.  Look after him as though he were yours,\u2019 and a tear rolled down her cheek.  The Stranger remembered an old village saying:\n\tA mother\u2019s love for her son never dies,\n\tNor can a son ever repay his mother\u2019s milk.\n\tA little later two brass jars were filled with water and had a marigold bud popped into each.  They were then set on either side of the door, on the lintel.  There was tension in the air and a little impatience was shown as in all imminent separations anywhere in the world with \u2018time, so precious, unwanted\u2019.  The two men were called forward and, as he came, the soldier picked up his baby boy (who still regarded his father as a complete stranger) and, with a wonderful smile, said his own farewell in his own sweet way, the infant resisting furiously.  Then, the mother to her son and the sister to the Stranger, first a garland round the neck, then a dab of rice, milk and saffron on the forehead and finally a brass bowl, filled with curds, guided to each man\u2019s lips without letting go, the age-old ritual of farewell was once more enacted.  Four pairs of hands moved, fluttered, joined in salutation, then dropped in poise and counter-poise as the simple ceremony came to a close.  The women stepped aside and in two short paces forward son, brother, husband and father bent to the brass ewers by the door.  He flicked water all around as well as on his head and over his shoulders, muttering prayers softly as he did.  The Stranger stole a glance at the three women.  The mother and sister were standing and the mother suckling her baby as she sat on the floor, all eyes were fixed on their man and they wept, silently, effortlessly and forlornly.  Then it was the Stranger\u2019s turn to cross the threshold and, feeling bogus, he merely bent his head and momentarily clasped his upturned hands together as he stepped outside, slightly at a loss, but relieved when the tension broke as last minute instructions were given about, of all things, a transistor radio licence.\n*\nMy one-time Borneogunmans, Bhimraj Gurung, was now on pension.  His villagers were wonderfully hospitable to a visitor and we walked a circuit together.  There was one man whom I was not allowed to visit because he was sick and near death.  Despite limited funds I paid for him and a carer to go to the military hospital in the east of the country.  He was cured and only died thirty years later.  I met his widow in a Buddhist temple ceremony fifty-five years later.  Now over ninety, she was so excited to see me we hugged each other, speechless with joy, both of us with a tear in our eyes.\n\tBecause of my act of kindness only the King\u2019s name and mine were taught the children in the village primary school from then on.\n\tOn my departure from the village Bhimraj\u2019s mother put a Nepali hat \u2018on the head of my English son\u2019.  We went down to Pokhara where I stopped at a shop to buy his mother and wife something to wear as a present for their hospitality.  I thought I had chosen well, a blouse of blue for the elder lady and of green for the younger.  I was gently told that my choice was completely wrong.  On my asking why I was told that the blouses had to be the same colour.  Again on my asking why I was told that meant there would be no quarrelling as to which was the prettier.  Oh1\n\tLater on that day when I opened a map to study the country, a friend from my 1/1 GR days hurriedly told me to hide it.  It was during the Land Reform time and I would have been taken as an unpopular functionary and possibly attacked had a group of protesters met me because, in my ignorance, I word the hat Bhimraj\u2019s mother had given me with the stitched border was on the wrong side of my head, the privilege of a government servant.\n*\nIn the east a highly decorated Gurkha officer felt he had not been given full recognition in only being made an Honorary Captain and not an Honorary Major, a rank that, in fact, did not exist.  He was so aggressive with me my porters slept around me and one tasted the food I was offered before I ate it.  A few days later, the officer attacked some policemen who had come to arrest him and killed one.  He escaped to India and only returned more than a decade later.\n\tOn my return I wrote a trek report in which I put \u2018I was surprised...\u2019 and the Major General in charge of Gurkhas wrote back \u2018I am surprised Cross was surprised.\u2019\nPENINSULAR MALAYSIA: 1967-1971\n76***\nAs Commandant of the JWS I found a marked difference in the approach of my British and  \u2018western\u2019 Commonwealth students and my Asian students to the Counter Revolutionary Warfare that we were teaching them.  The differences, I found, were that \u2018western\u2019 troops were not under the normal constraints of their home environment but, even so, creature comforts were at a premium.  Their upbringing was in an environment of confrontational politics so they had a more direct approach and were more critical than, and had less respect for, \u2018authority\u2019 than Asians.  An appreciation of the bawdy was shown when I summed up the final eight-day jungle exercise to an all British course I reminded them that at the beginning of the course I had said that I had stayed alive because I was basically suspicious and took a fundamental approach to jungle work.  My punch line was: \u2018Fellows, it was hard and it was good.  As the Good Little Girl said to the Bad Little Girl, \u201cis it hard to be good?\u201d the Bad Little Girl said to the Good Little Girl, \u201cit\u2019s got to be hard to be good\u201d.\u2019  I had a wonderful reception and a number of sergeants came to me later to tell me it was the best exercise summary they had ever heard \u2013 but woe betide my respect among Asian students had I dared to talk like that to a similar all-Thai or all-South Vietnamese course.  The joke I made at the end of my first opening address to the Thais would never have been made by an Asian.  I \u2018got away\u2019 with it as it was both unexpected and, despite my rank, I was a European.\n\tWesterners are snide: the Americans said that the Thais were \u2018the nicest people money can buy who play at their work and work at their play\u2019.  A Thai riposte of \u2018Americans are not polite\u2019 would, in Thai eyes, be the more damaging remark.  Asians take life with a dose of magic, westerners only accepted what in those days I called a \u2018slide-rule\u2019 mentality which needed everything to be quantified and qualified.  Many westerners at soldier level, in Asian eyes, are idle, noisy, wasteful, always sound angry, often appear unnecessarily stupid and seldom seem to realise when personal decorum has been violated.  True, but only to a point.  Certainly I have seen more British troops stoned out of their minds reeling about that I ever have Asians.\n\tI would tell my British students that Asians were tied by family considerations to the extent of appearing selfish, partisan and uninterested in Higher Authority.  A Vietnamese proverb has it that \u2018the king\u2019s writ stops at the village gate\u2019.  Nonetheless, there was more formality in a Chinese family than in a modern western one.\n\tNot that philosophy as such affected \u2018the ordinary man\u2019 but mind-sets always play their part in the way people react.  As has been said, \u2018One can\u2019t argue with a frame of mind\u2019.  Taoism makes the Chinese see that the most important part of a cup is the space where the liquid is held; one never sees the same river twice as the water is always changing; knowledge is not to know.  Westerners see that as devious if not plain stupid.  Many Asians unused to westerners \u2018say so much by leaving so much unsaid\u2019 by hint, inference, gesture, implied meaning and ambivalence.  The \u2018man in the paddy fields\u2019 is not inquisitive and has a degree of non-involvement resulting from many centuries at near starvation level when to reach the age of three is a victory.  Truth is like a Himalayan peak.  Lovely to look at, seems different from different angles, needs a tremendous effort to get there and, once there, to stay is to die so it is incumbent to descend.\n\tIn very poor countries, even to tell a stranger one\u2019s name is to give an advantage needlessly.  \u2018And, Gentlemen, never forget the wisdom of the oppressed: to bend is not to break but to survive; to be rigid is to break and not to survive.  Amen.\u2019\n77***\nNot being used to American terminology initially I was puzzled when I learnt that CINCPAC, a submarine Admiral, and his POLAD were to visit the JWS.  He came with his entourage that included a medical officer.  He was an engaging man of small stature.  I met him and his team, briefed them and took them to the Central Lecture Hall.  Going in front of the students I pointed out to the Admiral that the lecturer was an Australian Army Gunner to be introduced by a mMajor in the Gurkhas.  I pointed out students from South American, Europe, Africa, Asia and the Antipodes.  I told him we had Marine and Royal Air Force Regiment students.\n\tHe turned to me, bemused, and slowly asked \u2018Colonel, have you no submariners here?\u2019\n\tIn a stage whisper that all could hear, I answered \u2018Admiral, I have the finest submariner in the United States Navy standing right here beside me.\u2019\n\tAn expansive grin appeared on his craggy face: \u2018God damn it, son.  You win.\u2019\nSOUTH VIETNAM: 1969\n78***\nIn 1969 I went to South Vietnam as a guest of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, known as ARVN.  It was unrecognisable, completely and utterly: a different country from that which I had first known as Cochin-China in 1945.  Now it had a different name, a different flag; a different currency; and a different countryside, one arid, treeless and flat, bulldozed into a desert by the Americans.\n\tThere were two of us involved and our itinerary was confined to ARVN units.  Dignitaries and training establishment commanders were all listed: our brief from Saigon had also mentioned presentations, requesting anything but plaques.  The bayonet badge of the JWS on its green background was considered too humdrum compared with the gorgeous gifts protocol demanded the polite Vietnamese give their visitors.  Duly laden we set off, wisely (as it turned out) putting six plaques amongst our gifts, just in case.\n\tBy Day Five we had dispensed with all of our trophies and had gathered a motley collection in our own right, none as gorgeous as those we had given.  We felt smug that we had not been caught out.  Mid-morning we were suddenly told that we were going to lunch with a unit not on our list.  A disturbing thought struck me: would the British Army be found lacking in the \u2018plaque war\u2019?  I furtively asked the Liaison Officer, Lieutenant Colonel Duc, if I should start worrying about how to react to any ceremony.  \u2018Don\u2019t worry,\u2019 was his comforting rejoined.\n\tHalf an hour later, just before we were due to sit down to our meal, Duc unobtrusively sidled over to me and whispered, \u2018Start worrying.\u2019  He then furtively put four small bayonet-embossed JWS \u2018graduation\u2019 brooches into my hand and continued with his message, \u2018Take them by surprise, just as they are sitting down.  Give away all four.  One to the Commandant, one to his Chief of Staff, one to his Staff Officer,\u2019 he pointed them out in turn, \u2018and give the fourth to the American adviser.\u2019\n\tI caught Duc\u2019s eye just the Commandant was about to sit down and, as he nodded, I gave a stentorian bellow, \u2018Gentlemen!  It is a great honour to me to with you today...and as a mark of my esteem I wish to pin the Graduation Brooch of the British Army\u2019s Jungle Warfare School on to you!\u2019  I fumbled a little with the pins and managed to fix the three Vietnamese brooches reasonably straight without impaling the victims.  I then turned round to the American adviser.  He was a giant: just under seven feet, plug-ugly and big with it.  I stood on tiptoe and attacked the pocket of his fatigue dress shirt.  His name plate glared at me, eye level, Colonel Angel Torres.  No one had yet sat down and when eventually I had finished, he spoke out loud and clear: \u2018Colonel, I\u2019m motivated.\u2019  We sat down to mutual applause.  In this instance my initial action had been greatly to my advantage and after we left the table my first task was most sincerely to thank Duc for coming to my rescue.  I presumed I was over all difficulties, but I was wrong.  That night we slept at Torres\u2019 post and slept unscathed.  It was, in fact, not attacked for some weeks but tension was in the air.\n\tMidday the following day we made ready to leave.  My room overlooked the small forecourt in front of the compound.  I heard semi-martial noises emanating therefrom and I was intrigued because they were American not Vietnamese voices.  I peeped out and there, in the hot sun, were six American soldiers lined up in two ranks of three with a subordinate officer in the act of saluting Colonel Angel Torres as though he were handing over a parade.  I withdrew; nothing to do with me.  I left my room five minutes later and saw the gallant Colonel now facing his front, all standing at ease.  As I was espied, he called out to me, \u2018Come here, Colonel!\u2019  As I went over to him he did an unusual but neat about face and brought the group of seven to attention.  I was nonplussed but, always hoping to please, went and stood beside him.  Maybe he wants a group photo, I thought.\n\tThe Colonel, now of even more imposing presence  to me as we were in the open, again made another about face.  He put his hand up in a salute and said, in a loud and commanding voice: \u2018Colonel, the -th American Advisory Group.  I hand them over to you.  They\u2019re yours.\u2019  My hand immediately came up in an answering salute but, apart from that, the situation was temporarily beyond me.\n\tWe were standing side by side, I facing one way, he the other.  I redressed the balance of power as best I could.  \u2018Colonel,\u2019 I intoned, \u2018I hand them back.  They\u2019re yours again.\u2019\n\tI heard an audible sigh of relief some eighteen inches above my head, a scuffle of boots and Angel Torres swung round and we stood facing the same direction once more, the long and the short of it.  Turning to me, he gave me that which he had been clasping in his left hand the while, a brand-new, still tacky plaque of the -th American Advisory Group.\n\tI accepted it, not quite knowing what to say, but as Angel Torres dismissed his parade, a happy thought struck me.\n\t\u2018Colonel, thanks,\u2019 I said.  \u2018I\u2019m motivated.\u2019\nPENINSULAR MALAYSIA: 1969-1971\n79***\nThe jungles around South Johore had seen a fair share of guerrilla activity as well as the more mundane manoeuvrings of soldiers from all five continents during their training at the JWS.  For my part, much of the time in 1971 was spent on problems concerning the setting up of what the school was to become; the Commonwealth Jungle Warfare Centre.  However, I did manage some time on training as when a delegation from the ARVN came to see the final phase of the very last course run for their soldiers, and I took them all into the jungle, supposedly for a twenty-four-hour period.  The delegation head was a Colonel of Rangers, in charge, so he said, of more than thirty battalions.  He had three officers with him so, counting the five Guiding Officers for the ARVN students, we were a larger than normal party.  A complicated fly-in by helicopter took them to the focal point of the exercise.  They made a desultory walk round the positions and even spoke to some of the students.  We then brewed up tea for them.  After pleasantries and a few throw-away remarks about the superiority of ARVN to British Army tactics, the Colonel suddenly announced that they all had an important dinner date in Singapore and had to leave for it there and then.  They would not be back in time for the final attack in the morning.  After frantic re-scheduling of plans the group was flown away.  In truth, I was not at all surprised when they did not stay, nor were the students.  As an earnest of a ten-year training programme coming to its close, however, it left something to be desired.\n\tThe \u2018enemy\u2019 on these exercises were Gurkha soldiers from the school demonstration company.  Theirs was a thankless task, involving long periods of patient practice for demonstrations as well as even longer periods of setting up and coping with tactical incidents when the students almost always won.  In the former role they dressed in normal issue green; in the latter they wore black pyjamas, simulating the Vietcong.\n\tThe final attack always took place in the early morning.  This was the culminating event after a week\u2019s exercise when the \u2018enemy\u2019 hide-out had to be destroyed having been finally discovered the previous day: the \u2018enemy\u2019 either ran away or lay \u2018dead\u2019 after the victorious students had assaulted.  All went according to plan on this last day until one of the students came across Bhakt\u00e9 lying \u2018dead\u2019 by a trench.  Maybe the sight of the black \u2018uniform\u2019 mesmerised him into forgetting himself or maybe it was just the excitement of the moment; he rolled Bhakt\u00e9 over with his foot and kicked him sharply in the teeth.  The hand-to-hand struggle that ensued was in deadly earnest.  As they were being separated the exercise was abruptly terminated and the other students sent some distance away.  Bhakt\u00e9 then went berserk.  A small man, he was unbelievably strong.  It took four of us to get him under control.\n\tGradually he quietened.  I got all the helpers to stand aside and I sat beside him, holding his sleeve, talking to him.  All the tension of being part of the demonstration troops welled up and out.  Bhakt\u00e9 had been hit by a wad of blank ammunition at five yards range by an ARVN student only three weeks prior.  His resentment was bitter and determined but fervently unrealistic.\n\t\u2018Either you let me kick him in the teeth or you let me cut him.\u2019  Even if an eye was not for an eye, a tooth was definitely needed for a tooth.  As a skilled tactician who knows when he is favourable ground, he declined to budge at all.  In vain did I explain as best I could the ramifications and subtleties of the complex international situation: I had no jurisdiction over any ARVN man, nor could I accommodate Bhakt\u00e9 in his lust for revenge.  He repeated his ultimatum.  I countered; \u2018either you accept his apology or you\u2019ll let me report the whole matter to ARVN HQ in Saigon.\u2019\n\t\u2018No.\u2019\n\tHe got up and went over to where his hoochy was and packed up his kit.  He then sat down again, took out his kukri and started honing the blade.  I realised I must defuse the situation, and quickly at that.\n\tI called over Corporal Minbahadur, as tall and strong a man as I knew.  I explained my plan to him.  \u2018You will take your squad down to the river, along the path where the ARVN students are waiting for further orders.  You will stay behind Bhakt\u00e9 all the time and not let him draw his kukri \u2013 whatever happens.  Once we have reached the Vietnamese, I\u2019ll get the man who kicked him to shake hands.\u2019  I showed more confidence that I felt.  Minbahadur, a man I had long known, showed no emotion.\n\tSo we moved off down the path towards the Vietnamese students, just ten Gurkhas and myself.  The ARVN Guiding Officer, who had stayed back to help the exercise, declined to go with us.  Some distance down the track, in a glade, we came across the thirty ARVN students.  The leading Gurkha hesitated but I ordered him on.  At the end of the group Bhakt\u00e9 stayed where he was, eyeing all the students balefully, looking for his target.  I felt that, were there to be another set-to, we would be unwise to remain split.  I urged Bhakt\u00e9 forward.  We passed through the Vietnamese who stayed silent.  On the farther side of the students the Gurkhas stopped and looked at s me, faces impassive.  I turned towards the Vietnamese who, politely and in chorus, wished me good morning.  They refused to say anything until their Guiding Officer, Captain Minh, arrived, anxiously breathless, obviously an unwilling participant.  He immediately launched into an effusion of collective sympathy, shock and shame, and ended up by offering a corporate apology.  I translated.  Bhakt\u00e9 declined.  \u2018The one who kicked me must come forward,\u2019 he said.\n\tNo one stirred when I turned to Captain Minh and declined his offer.  Captain Minh decided not to stay and tension mounted.  Suddenly Bhakt\u00e9 pointed at one of the students.  \u2018He\u2019s the one!\u2019 he growled.  The man so singled out went green and, on my ordering him forward, slowly got to his feet.  Bhakt\u00e9 equally slowly took his pack off, laid it on the ground and felt for his kukri.  I glanced at Minbahadur who put his hand very firmly on the handle.\n\t\u2018Come here,\u2019 I said to the Vietnamese.  Hesitantly, unwillingly, he came forward.  I caught hold of his right wrist with my left hand.\n\u2018Come here,\u2019 I said to Bhakt\u00e9.  With equal difficulty I caught hold of his right wrist with my right hand.\n\tRather like the referee in a tug-of-war competition trying to align the centre of the rope over the centre of the pulling area, I tried to bring two hands together.  I failed.  The two men jerked away from me.  Two paces to me left for the Vietnamese, two paces to my right for Bhakt\u00e9.  \u2018Shake hands!\u2019 I rasped out twice as I tugged them towards each other.  I failed again.\n\tBy now all the students had a hard look in their eyes, while the man who had kicked Bhakt\u00e9 looked hunted and near to breaking point.  Bhakt\u00e9 looked ferociously red-eyed.  The other Gurkhas were tense.  I felt desperate.\n\t\u2018Come here!\u2019 I snapped at the Vietnamese, lunged at him and pulled him towards me.  \u2018Give me your hand and shake his, or else...\u2019 I snarled at Bhakt\u00e9 and, such was my fear at failure transmuted into strength, I did get them to shake hands.\n\tI turned and dismissed the Gurkhas, sending them on down the track. I turned back, thanked the students for the apology and said that tempers would now cool.\n\tI left them to rejoin the Gurkhas, sweatingly thankful that I had managed at the third and last time of asking.\n\tWhen, on the morrow, the students left to go back to Vietnam I was warmly thanked for having averted what they saw as a grave crisis.  I was thoroughly embarrassed by one of the more emotional coming up to me, was he Green Gills? and kissing me.\n80***\nThais and South Vietnamese students had their individual courses at the JWS.  Although interpreters came with them I decided to learn both languages to a standard I could give simple lectures.  I also learnt the script of both languages.\n\tOn a visit to the Thai military HQ in Bangkok I went searching for a book with a military vocabulary.  I found one and the only few English words were at the back.  I read them with amazement: \u2018If a diplomat says \u201cyes\u201d he means perhaps, if he says \u201cperhaps\u201d he means no and if he says \u201cno\u201d his is no diploma; if a lady says \u201cno\u201d she means perhaps, if she says \u201cperhaps\u201d she means yes and if she says \u201cyes\u201d she is no lady.\u2019\n81***\nThe High Commissioner in Singapore, Mr Arthur de la Mare, came to the JWS on one Visitors\u2019 Day.  He told me that when he had been the ambassor in Bangkok embassy with Gurkha guards he thought that the night prowlers were not doing their duties properly.  He told me he was therefore anti-Gurkha and needed a good reason to get rid of them as embassy guards.  He thought up a scheme whereby he would catch the prowler guard out and so have his good reason to change the guard set-up so get rid of the Gurkhas.  So one night around midnight, dressed in slacks and a white shirt, he left the residency by the front door which he locked behind him.  He saw no prowler guard nor could he find one as he went to the guard room at the main gate.  \u2018I had keys for the two wicket gates that led onto a side road,\u2019 and he made his way to one of them.  Still no sign of any prowler guard.  \u2018As I unlocked the gate on my own, I\u2019ll get him,\u2019 he told me.  He relocked the gate, turned too quickly and fell off the small bridge into the dirty wataer of the roadside \u2018khlong\u2019.  Cursing, he had a short fuse, he scrambled out, soaking wet, smelly and covered in duckweed.  He stormed down the road and entered the embassy grounds again through the other wicket gate.  Still no signs of any prowler guard.  \u2018\u201cI\u2019ve got you.  I\u2019ll sack the whole lot of you,\u201d I said to myself,\u2019 he told me.  He got back to his residence, foul tempered and turned to open the front door.  As he did, there was a voice behind him: \u2018Anything else sir?\u2019  \u2018I turned and there was the prowler sentry, soaked, smelly and covered in duckweed.  I was shaken rigid and after that I trusted the Gurkhas so I kept them on as embassy guards,\u2019 he said.\n82***\nAs the situation in Vietnam deteriorated so did the morale of the Vietnamese students.  I wondered if and how I could improve it.  Once every course the School gave such students a party on the east coast on a wide expanse of sandy beach at Jason\u2019s Bay, not all that far from Mersing.  Swimming, beach football, volley ball and lolling about were the chief attractions.  On this particular Saturday, in mid-December 1970, games palled and lacklustre students sat around listlessly.  It was as good a time as any to see if my home-made remedy to improve morale worked or not.\n\tA curry lunch was provided.  I had learnt two Vietnamese songs and recorded them both.  One song, of haunting beauty, was about a youth who went to the war and was killed.  The other also had a haunting refrain, was equally nostalgic but shorter.\n\tAfter lunch I fetched my tape recorder, sat down with the course Guiding Officers and played a song.  Several of the more despondent students gathered around and the British instructos with their families took notice.  When the last notes of the song had faded away I was, as I knew I would be, called on by one of the Guiding Officers to put sing my own Vietnamese song..\n\tI had written the words of \u2018The Rain on the Leaves\u2019 out on cards, put them inside my hat and had kept my hat on.  I took off my hat, not letting anyone see the cards and sang the whole song through, all eight verses, the students joining in halfway through.  All the British, Australian and New Zealand permanent staff and their wives sensed an uplift of spirit.  The course was the best we had on record.  These are the words of the first of two songs I sang:\n\tThe rain on the leaves:\n\tIs the tears of joy of the girl whose boy returns from the war.\n\tIs the bitter tears when the mother hears her son is no more.\n\tIs the cry that is torn from a baby just born as life is begun.\n\tIs an old couples\u2019 love much greater now than when they were young.\n\tIs a passionate voice in a final choice when last love is near.\n\tIs a voice surprised as it realised its first love is here\n\tIs a heart\u2019s distress and a loneliness as life passes by.\n\tIs a last caress and a tenderness before love can die,\nand it was only later I discovered that the South Vietnam government had banned the song. \n*\nBefore the ARVN students left we sat down forty-eight to a traditional Christmas dinner, with crackers and a tree with a present for each one of them.  They had never had a \u2018mess night\u2019 and before we sat down they all sang a paean of praise.  They pulled the crackers by themselves and had fruit before the mince pies as they said it prevented them from becoming drunk.  I stood up and said I hoped peace would come to their country soon and that they would beat the Communists.  I called for a toast for the President of Vietnam, the British Queen, the Vietnamese Army, their families, the bachelors\u2019 girl friends.  After the toast was drunk and they had sat down, they sang their thanks in unison.\n83***\nIn late October 1971 the British government announced that it was pulling all its forces away from \u2018the east of Suez\u2019 less for those in Hong Kong and Brunei where most, if not nearly all expenses would be paid for by the host government.  There were to be a hundred British troops in the new five-nation Commonwealth Jungle Warfare Centre and I was seen as the Chief Instructor.  The Commandant was to be Colonel Lai, one of the four Chinese \u2018Supermen\\ announced by the Governor-cum-Command-in-Chief of Malays in 1953, General Sir Gerald Templer.  When asked by Lai if I was happy to serve under him I said indeed I was.  I also learnt that the Malays had forbidden Lai to accept any invitations we gave him for meals and accommodation.  Unbelievable nonsense we all thought.\n\tThis Malayan jealousy, or fear? of an up-and-coming Chinese army officer resulted in Lai\u2019s appointment being cancelled and my own appointment not sanctioned because, as I learnt later, \u2018he knows more than any of us do so we would lose face with him as Chief Instructor.\u2019\n\tThat was \u2018par for the course\u2019, as golfers say: I had been secretly approached by the Malaysian Director of Infantry and asked how trouble of the Thai border and in Eastern Malaysia could be countered.  I told him.  \u2018We are most grateful but you will never get any official thanks.\u2019\n\tTwo weeks later headlines in the newspaper announced that General So-&-So had a battle-winning plan for the Thai border area and two weeks after that General Step-&-Fetch-It similarly had one for Eastern Malaysia.\n\tEven up to the very end I was the only officer of my rank not to be given another job.  I asked myself if it meant I had to leave the army.  We were visited by the Assistant Adjutant General, one Major General James Lunt, who spoke to me about my future.  Nothing was definite: I had been asked for as a Major-General in the Royal Thai Army to be in charge of CSOC, the Communist Suppression Operation Command; by the Singapore Armed Forces as a Commando battalion CO; by the Singapore Police as the CO of the Gurkha Contingent of the Singapore Police; recommended as Chief of Intelligence in Brunei; suggested as Consul in Shanghai; and offered by the British Government to Thailand and South Vietnam as adviser on Counter Revolutionary Warfare for six months of each year.  \u2018You have also been recommended as the Defence Attach\u00e9 in a southeast Asian country that I am unable to disclose,\u2019 the General finished up, looking at me before asking which job I\u2019d like.\n\tI said they all sounded interesting but I\u2019d go where sent.  \u2018My advice is stay with your own army.  Better for pension and you\u2019re better looked after.\u2019\n\t\u2018Then that means the attach\u00e9 job, sir?\u2019\n\t\u2018You won\u2019t be wanted until November 1972 but they\u2019ll be language and other sorts of training beforehand,\u2019 he told me as he got up to leave.\n\tWhat to do with the time between now and my attach\u00e9 training? I asked myself.  I was too senior to serve with the Gurkhas in Hong Kong or Brunei so after being an attach\u00e9 some boring home service job.  Not for me so I started thinking of leaving the army...  But I had several months before training for my new job started and, not having had any home leave for seven and a half years, decided to go on a long farewell trek in Nepal before going back to England.\n\tI had been on a short trek once before and found the crisp Himalaya air and villagers\u2019 friendship a tonic for jangled nerves after ten years of the Malayan Emergency.  I was more tired now so I planned a long trek.\nNEPAL: 1971-1972\n84***\nDuring the next one hundred and seven days my life was a mosaic of long walks, cold nights, wonderful views and meeting somebody I knew every day.  In my seventy days in the east I travelled with a soldier who was on the staff at the eastern recruiting camp at Dharan.\n\tOne day walking along a track I saw a man I knew who was ahead of me and I shouted something to him.  Between us an old, bent woman, walking with a stick, was coming towards me.  She stopped as I passed, looked up and asked in a quavering voice whether it was me, using a nickname I had been given.  \u2018Yes, Granny, it is.\u2019  She looked pleased and I asked her where she lived and how did she know who I was.  She told me that she lived three days\u2019 walk away and, five years before, I had spent one night in the house next door to hers.  She had heard my chatter through the walls, had laughed and, with my calling out to the man in front of me, had recognised my voice!\n*\nWhile planning my trek, I had been asked by a soldier, Krishnabahadur Rai, if I\u2019d visit his house, taking a letter to his father.  I told him to explain where his village was and, in due course, my soldier-guide told me it was an hour\u2019s walk, down in the valley.\n\tWinter was over when we reached my guide's home high up on a ridge but the cold wind was still bitter, bringing flurries of late snow.  He had business to attend to so suggested I went down the valley to Jasbahadur\u2019s house and deliver the letter to his father.\n\t\u2018It\u2019s warmer down there than up here.  Time you stopped shivering!\u2019  He grinned at me.  \u2018Leave tomorrow morning after your meal.  You\u2019ll be there by noon, I\u2019ll send my younger brother as guide.\u2019\n\t\u2018That\u2019s fine.  I\u2019ll be back by late afternoon.\u2019\n\tHe eyed me, hesitated, then said, \u2018I\u2019ll expect you when I see you but don\u2019t forget we\u2019re due to move off north for a week or so in two days from now.\u2019\n\tThe weather grew warmer as we descended and I appreciated it.  From a vantage point I saw a large house, strongly built and surprisingly gracious of aspect.  It was surrounded by an orchard of orange, apple and peach trees, all starting to bloom.  There were banana plants and a vegetable garden.  A short walk up the slope was a poorer house with the surrounding land ill-kempt.  A row of trees ran between the two areas, the richer and the poorer, almost like a dividing line of falling golden rain, so profuse were the flowers.\n\t\u2018That\u2019s where we\u2019re heading for\u2019, my guide told me.\n\t\u2018What are those trees with yellow flowers?\u2019 I asked him.\n\t\u2018Laburnum,\u2019\n\tBarking dogs brought the family out, women and children first then, a minute or so later, a stiff-backed old patriarch, the master of the house.  He looked at me inquiringly but said nothing.  I went up to him and made the customary salutation.  \u2018I\u2019m your son Krishn\u00e9\u2019s officer.  I come with his greetings, bearing a letter from him to you.  He is in good health and doing well.\u2019\n\tKrishn\u00e9\u2019s eighty-year-old father, Jaimordhan Rai, the elder brother lived in the lower and better plot of land: his younger brother, Dhanmordhan Rai, aged sentry-six, had the upper and less fertile.  The two old men had been enemies for more than half a century.  Their quarrel had its roots in the distribution of their inheritance.  Local legend had it that the division of the two properties was a line of old laburnum trees but according to the younger brother that was not where their father had intended it to be.  Claim and counter-claim had soured relations to such an extent that the two men only ever met when an important visitor arrived, otherwise they went their own way, armed with kukris against an attack but the other.\n\tThe old man, still not talking, gestured that a chair be brought for me.  He then winced and put his hand over his mouth.  He was obviously in great pain.\n\tAfter refreshment had been offered the old man leant over to me and, with a great effort, said, in a straightforward way that brooked no argument; \u2018You are my guest.  You will stay here until the day after tomorrow, spending two nights in my house.  No friend of Jaimordhan Rai ever stays less.\u2019\n\tHe paused, winced and put his hand to his face as though nursing his mouth.  He shook his head obstinately when I remonstrated that in no way could I abuse his hospitality for so long and, anyway, I had to move farther north the next day.\n\tHe turned to my guide and dismissed him curtly: \u2018You heard.  Tell that up there to your elder brother.  Be off now.  I\u2019ll look after my son\u2019s saheb and arrange for an escort from here when the time comes.\u2019\n\tBefore I could expostulate further we were joined by another old man who came down the hill.  He looked furtively about then asked, Nepalese style, not directly to me but to another, who I was.  No one answered so he introduced himself as the younger brother, Dhanmordhan Rai, Krishn\u00e9\u2019s uncle, from the house up the hill.  The two old men sedulously ignored each other except when the dictates of convention compelled otherwise.  It was embarrassing and I felt uneasy; two days and two nights, I dismally thought, during an awkward silence as I remembered to gossip I\u2019d picked up on my way.\n\tI turned to my host and said he seemed to be in pain.\n\t\u2018My tooth ache is so bad, has been for six months, that I could easily hang myself from one of my fruit trees and relieve myself for ever from this wicked pain.  I haven\u2019t had a proper meal since it started.\u2019\n\tIt was at least ten days\u2019 walk to the nearest dentist and then there was no guarantee of anything being done when he got there.  Also it was a tremendous effort for the old man, who lived in hopes that his tooth would get better of itself.  That gave me an idea: escape was impossible that day, but as I had some Chinese toothache dope in my kit in my guide\u2019s house, I thought I\u2019d offer to go and fetch it for him the next day \u2013 then, having escaped, send it back down.\n\tThat evening, after our meal, Jaimordhan, torn between pain and the dictates of hospitality, sat and talked.  I egged him on judiciously, and Iearnt his side of the quarrel between the two brothers.  It seemed that the division of the two properties was the line of laburnum trees but that was disputed.  It struck me as so sad that such a feud, having festered for so long, would probably outlive them both and continue into the next generation.\n\tMy bed was to be one side of the porch.  I was surprised to see two lots of blankets brought out.  I was put on one side and my host slept on the other, with a kukri by his side and a lantern burning all night.  He had slept with that particular kukri ever since the quarrel started.  Before we went to sleep I put my plan to him and he only acquiesced when I said I\u2019d come back down for the other night after my journey north.\n\tI bade farewell after our meal next morning.  I told the old man to send someone with me to bring back the phial of dope and before I left I demonstrated how to put some cotton wool on a sliver of wood...\n\t...I returned twelve days later.  The whole family turned out to greet me.  I was amazed to see the two old men, the two brothers, now sitting side by side.  They seemed happy to be with each other where before the opposite had been the case.  I was garlanded and made to sit between them.\n\t\u2018We want to tell you,\u2019 said Jaimordhan, \u2018that we have made up our quarrel.  And it is all thanks to you!\u2019\n\t\u2018Yes,\u2019 chimed Dhanmordhan, \u2018that is so.  We are now talking to each other properly after more than fifty years.\u2019\n\tThey could only tell me that the toothache was completely cured and, in the euphoria of no pain and being able to eat again, Jaimordhan had told his brother to sniff,which he had done.  The magic of the dope had persuaded him to take the hand of reconciliation that his elder brother had proffered.  It was all rather wonderful and far beyond the expectations of any of us, including myself.\n\tLater on that day I paid Dhanmordhan a visit in his house.  Before I went I examined the dope and made it a permanent present for my host.  As I walked back down to stay a second night in the lower house, I guessed the secret of the dope\u2019s magic.  Apart from curing toothache by its mild poison killing the damaged nerves, its latent power of patching up quarrels probably lay in the fact that it had a laburnum base (as I had read when I gave it to Jaimordhan) and the smell of it had subtly reminded them of the smell of the yellow blossoms of the laburnums that had unconsciously taken them both back to childhood years of happiness.\n\tAlthough that is pure conjecture, the kukri that Jaimordhan had slept with all those years is very real.  It is in my possession, given as a token of that magical day.\n\tYears later I learnt from Krishn\u00e9 that neither of them had quarrelled again for as long as they lived.\n85***\nDuring the ten-day intermission my guide told me a long story, which I encapsulate: the barren, boulder-strewn, steep hillside where the man had been born was five days hard walk away when he who had left home to make good found himself tired and hungry, near his destination, but at the bottom of a steep hill.  He travelled light but, even so, found the way up the hill a strain as there was nowhere he could rest till he reached the top and the track was difficult with loose stones.  He envisaged a resting place half way, just where he had noticed a cooling breeze (for it was then at the end of April and the weather had turned hot).  \u2018When I have my first son,\u2019 he mused, \u2018I will pay for a flagged path and a resting place to be made.\u2019  He saw, in his mind's eye, the square stone platform, the chautara, with the shelf all around it where a man could easily rest his load.\n\tTwo trees were always planted together on a chautara, the bar (banyan) and the papal (peepal).  Custom, from time immemorial, has required these trees be married by the priests, just like man and woman, with correctly read divinations found from the almanac.  He day-dreamed further: \u2018How wonderful if my son\u2019s marriage and that of the trees coincided.\u2019  As he lulled himself to sleep that night he mentally completed the picture by envisaging the little stone-flagged tank some yards in front of the chautara with the carved wooden pole so essential to ritual, sticking up in the water.  Unluckily his eldest son and the trees were far too young to be married when he unexpectedly died.\n\tThe years passed.  The son grew up under his mother\u2019s care but his father\u2019s dream of a joint marriage never materialised.  There was only enough money for his marriage, none for the two trees.  \u2018Never mind,\u2019 the son thought.  \u2018My eldest son\u2019s birth will be an occasion for this to happen.\u2019\n\tHowever, despite all hopes, he did not sire a son and heir, only a daughter.  He was a diligent worker and by the standards of the time, some sixty years previously, was rich.  He told his friends about his hopes and day-dreams when he took counsel with them on how to remedy such matters.  It was pronounced that he should make a vow for the bar and the pipal to be properly and expensively married and he would be blessed with a son.\nNow there were two servants, nicknamed Gophl\u00e9 (the one with chubby cheeks) and Sikut\u00e9 (the thin one), trusted implicitly, but who were, unfortunately, filled with greed at their master's richness.  They were cunning, clever and low-minded, contriving to act both at the marriage ceremony and for its preparation in such a way that they could get their hands on the money and escape with it.  In this they were successful and both managed to get away unscathed, with enough money to make themselves significantly richer than those with whom they eventually found themselves.\n\tThe fury of the deprived man was only matched by the disappointment, at remaining unrewarded, of those whose counsels he had needed.  A curse was put on both the thieves that they too should never have any sons and that, however successful their money might seem to make them, they be doomed to disappointment.\n\tMore years passed.  Sikut\u00e9 married and built a house.  The house was robbed and later collapsed in an earthquake.  His fowls were continuously taken by jackals and his one daughter was born a simpleton.  She grew up, married, had a family and all, less the son-in-law, were mortally stricken.  The son-in-law remarried and had eight children, five being \u2018touched by the gods\u2019.  The villagers shunned them and shed no tear when three of them, along with their grandfather, died.  Somehow or other the curse was implicitly known of if never explicitly discussed.  The house in which the remnants of the family lived was ill-starred and even when Sikut\u00e9's son-in-law and second wife died within two days of one another, the unintelligible prattle and dangerous tantrums of the two remaining hapless ones were grim reminders of the folly of the act of greed that prevented a significant act of devotion.\n\tGophl\u00e9 moved to a different area and likewise produced no son.  A similar catalogue as Sikut\u00e9\u2019s would be tedious; suffice it to say that he was still alive then and despised and shunned by other villagers as being a load-mouthed, cantankerous bully who still lived under the strain of the curse.\n\t\u2018How do you know all this?\u2019 I asked my companion at the end of this involved story.\n\t\u2018One of the thieves was my grandfather,\u2019 he replied, \u2018and you saw what my uncles were like in my village before we moved to last night\u2019s place.  It so happened that the other thief was the owner of the house we were staying in last night.\u2019\n*\nIn another village I met an old friend, a Gurkha Captain, Narbahadur Rai.  He had married late for a Gurkha, after the Burma War, and had raised a large and contented family.  His youngest son, aged six, was the apple of his father's eye.\n\tWhen on pension he was elected the village leader and soon had a school built for primary classes.  The village was to be honoured by an unusually high official visiting it.  \tGreat activity ensued.  Village paths were repaired, broken walls restored and the school re-decorated.  Outside the school was a large boulder that was not embedded in the ground but lay slightly tilted.  It offended Narbahadur's sense of tidiness as the gap had become a collecting place of waste.  He decided to try and get it flush with the ground so he arranged for a group of twenty-four men armed with crowbars to move it.  It was a feat to find enough crowbars for the job but, try hard as they might, they could not budge the boulder at all.\n\tNarbahadur's youngest son was a spectator to this and, on the morrow, when all the men were away doing something else, he crawled into the gap between boulder and ground to remove the rubbish and thereby please his father.  No sooner was he underneath when the boulder, obviously loosened by the exertions of the previous day, subsided.  An indentation in the ground allowed just enough room for the little boy's head to be undamaged, but not so his body, which was almost, but not quite, crushed outright.\n\tSome little girls playing nearby rushed to get help when they saw what had happened, but with all the men away the womenfolk were unable to organise themselves.  Narbahadur's eldest daughter, however, saw the need for immediate action.  In desperation, she told all the other little girls to run back to the scene of the accident and try to move the boulder by themselves.  Their search for help had taken twenty minutes, an uncomfortably long time under the circumstances, but a muffled bleat from the little boy showed he was still alive, albeit probably hideously broken.  So, armed with pieces of wood, a dozen little girls, aged between eight and twelve, tried with might and main to shift the boulder.  With superhuman strength, they managed to lift it sufficiently high and just long enough for one little girl to snatch the trapped boy from underneath before the sheer weight of rock exerted its overpowering pressure and it again subsided.\n\tThe lad was laid on the ground, purple-faced with near suffocation, as his father rushed to the scene.  Narbahadur very gently lifted his son up, even more carefully took his shirt off and, when he realised that the only damage was a large and ugly bruise, unashamedly wept.\n\t\u2018Wasn't that miraculous?\u2019 I asked him.\n\t\u2018Yes,\u2019 he replied.  \u2018I cannot explain what happened except to say that the gods helped me out.  To show my appreciation I have had a chautara made and a bar and a pipal tree planted and have vowed that they be properly married...on the same day as my son, if possible, as my grandfather had once so wished for my father.\u2019\n\t[I went through that same village twice after Narbahadur Rai\u2019s death.  I asked if any of his family were still in the village and I was directed to a shop run by his son.  I asked the son if the story about one of his father\u2019s children being nearly crushed under a stone was true and he said, yes, it was he himself who had so nearly lost his life.  The second time I was in the village I again asked after him and was told he had gone to Hong Kong.]\n86***\nI was walking to the house of a corporal who had been a parachutist with me.  I learnt that he had left for Calcutta so, maybe, that would be the first day I met no one I had known before.  I saw a middle-aged man walking to me as if still on parade.  He seemed familiar so I stopped him and asked him if he knew me.\n\t\u2018What is your regiment?\u2019 he asked abruptly, almost rudely.\n\tI told him and he said that he was a Subedar of 1/5 Gorkha Rifles who had no knowledge of me.\n\tBy now I was sure of myself.  I said \u2018Subedar saheb, twenty six years ago you were the lance naik [lance corporal] in 4/6 GR, based in the Red Fort in Delhi and, in the October, you came south to Kamthi, Nagpur, to take over from my battalion, 1/1 GR.  I was in charge of the vehicles and you were in charge of the petrol and oil.\u2019  A look of enquiry spread over his face.  \u2018I spent the whole of one day trying to teach you the VDRA [vehicle daily running account] to you.\u2019\n\tHe stiffened to attention and saluted.  \u2018Yes, saheb, you are correct.\u2019\n\tWe parted and I was, in a stupid way, happy to have kept my daily record.\nDREAMS\n87***\nNepalis put great store in their dreams  When I was on my long trek in Nepal and although nobody knew of my itinerary I was met twice by men who had dreamt of my presence, one I had seen for five years and the other I had not see for ten.  A third man who knew that I\u2019d try and visit his house \u2018sometime in the next six months\u2019 dreamt that I\u2019d be with him in two days\u2019 time so pratised his village drama team the previous day: and he was correct!\n\tHunger dreams we all experienced when working with the Temiar affected us similarly: we went back into childhood.  I dreamt I was on my mother\u2019s knee, reciting my kindergarten homework and giggling foolishly.  During the night I\u2019d be offered food and I\u2019d reach for it, bring it my mouth and it would disappear. I would awake drooling and with tears in my eyes.  I\u2019d look at my watch and see it was only an hour since the last one.  I\u2019d fill my stomach with water to relieve the pangs and go to sleep of another hour before I\u2019d be offered food again.  I have only worn a wrist watch twice since, both on test exercises.\n\tThe dreams I valued most were those two that my bother Tim, although dead, successfully advised me what to do under the most tense of circumstances, one being when detailed to take the Yamagishi butai against the Vietcong and the other before my regular commission board in Singapore.\n\tOne night in the jungle I dreamt I was flying by waving my arms.  At our morning brew I told my men and they said that meant my mother was ill.  I dismissed that as she never was \u2013 except, I found out she was the night I could fly.\n\tNepalis never mention any dream with bad news.  My Buddhiman told me about a bad dream only nine years he\u2019d seen it and only because I asked him.  We were at the two-hundredth anniversary of my Indian Army battalion, 1/1 GR, at the time when he had had two nightmares, both of which woke him.  He had a cold shower after each and prayed.  In essence the water in a river near his village home turned into fire and only the quick damming of it and changing its flow by his mother saved their house.  Two days later we learnt that a major earthquake in Nepal and miraculously large cracks in the earth were on either side of his village so no damage was caused to it.\n\tOther bad dreams are spilling milk, when an ox runs away from the plough and going into your house.  Before I knew of this last bit of bad luck, I dreamt a couple of times when I whistled the dogs from outside my house and my parents knew I had come back on leave.  One night in early 1946 I had gone home in my dream and no dogs came when I whistled.  I went round the house, found the back door open and went inside.  In the kitchen I found my brother Tim wiping plates.  \u2018I thought you were dead,\u2019 I said and he answered \u2018I am and I\u2019m mot/\u2019\n\tI took a pistol out of my pocket, shot and killed him.  \u2018You\u2019re dead now,\u2019 I said.\n\tSo sorry was I that I woke up the person who shared my room by my weeping.  Apart from helping me on my regular commissions board a month later, he has never returned to me in a dream \u2013 and I dream nightly.  \nLAOS: 1972-1976\n88***\nLaos (it rhymes with \u2018mouse\u2019 not with \u2018chaos\u2019 though the uncharitable often thought that it should) was the country I was to go to as the Defence Attach\u00e9, one of the two countries in southeast Asia, the other being Cambodia, I had yet to visit or know anything about.  It was lucky I did not have any idea of the challenges that awaited me.  An attach\u00e9 is the accredited military representative for the collection of open military information, collected by observation, extrapolation and common-sense methods.  Never to betray a confidence or a source is of paramount importance and information is never to be obtained by financial or other untoward means.  Unlike the communist world, attach\u00e9s of the old Commonwealth countries are not \u2018official spies\u2019.\n\tMy training for this completely new type of job was linguistic and technical.  I had a hundred and sixty hours of French lessons which equalled five years of a normal school syllabus.  I was not initially allowed any Lao language training but I fought for and won a sixty-hours training session to run concurrently with the last sixty hours of French.  My teacher was a niece of the King of Laos, a stunningly beautiful woman who was a secretary in the Lao embassy in London.  Apart from totally losing my heart to her \u2013 did she ever realise it? \u2013 she later told an elder sister, Jasmine, in Vientiane that I needed more lessons.  (Fast forward: I would go round to Jasmine who was an excellent teacher.  Her older sister, I think there were nine of them, was not nearly as pretty as the others I met.  One day she gave me a cabbage to take back to my house and I thought of those old phrase books having \u2018the ugly princess gave the English colonel a cabbage.\u2019  In fact, the most useless phrase ever taught me was \u2018the pied cuckoo, cuculos melanoleucos, which, according to legend lives on rain drops, is in a jujube tree, ziziphus jujube.\u2019)\n\tI was to be an accredited representative of Her Britannic Majesty\u2019s Government, with full diplomatic immunity and accreditation was to the Kingdom of Laos.  I was to be the adviser on all defence matters to the ambassador, the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence.\n\tTechnical training included how to use a camera surreptitiously.  One task was to photograph the odometer through the window of a parked car.  I was given a telephone number to give to any inquisiteive person who suspected my motives.  Another was to go in an open boat down the Thames and photograph the bottom of bridges passed under: then I merely felt foolish.\n\tI was severely warned that I might find pressure and temptations unusual to one who was used to living in a comparatively closeted atmosphere of an officers\u2019 mess as I would have a house in town.  Apparently I was the only service attach\u00e9 who was a bachelor.  That, and being a linguist, made me would make me an interesting target to the communist fraternity, being a challenge to them.\n\tLastly, being on the fringe of the intelligence world but not of it, I would be working on a \u2018need to know\u2019 basis.  I was to operate entirely overtly, never covertly \u2013 dire consequences were threatened were I to disregard that strict rule.  Nor should I ever forget that golden maxim \u2018we are our own shop window.\u2019\n89***\nOn 23 February 1973 a cease fire between the Royal Lao Government (RLG) and the Lao Patriotic Front (LPF) was put into effect.  There was a pleasing story doing the rounds as to why that date was chosen when, two days before, the event seemed remote.  The Prime Minister, Prince Souvanna Phouma, had a fixation for figures, especially those that had some affinity with each other.  The war had been going on for 23 years, and 23 February was a coincidence too good to be missed.  He also saw additional merit with 2 x 3 = 6, a figure divisible both by 2 and 3 with a happy answer of 3 and 2.\n90***\nOn entering the embassy for the first time with the out-going DA, Colonel Donald Thursby-Pelham, I spoke Lao to those local functionaries I met, doormen, messengers and the like.  I was amazed and dismayed to be peremptorily put down by Donald as \u2018not the least bit necessary\u2019 as no one did.  It was only months later that I discovered that the senior cleaner was the communist link; he had overheard me and gave \u2018them\u2019 a good report.  It turned out strongly in my favour.\n\tLater I learnt that common Lao phrase for \u2018it doesn\u2019t matter\u2019, bor pen nyang, used to shrug off anything untoward.\n\tThat first day was the monthly attach\u00e9 luncheon, this time thrown by the out-going Thai.  We drove to a restaurant run by a Taiwanese and here I met all the other attach\u00e9s and the members of the ICSC, the International Control and Supervision Commission (ISCS).  Only the Chinese DA, who took no part in such frivolities, was absent.  Conversation alternated between English and French and was anodynely bland until the Thai ordered champagne.  As the corks popped Donald looked at his Soviet counterpart, Colonel Vladimir Gretchanine, accusingly and said that it was like the North Vietnamese Army, the NVA, using Soviet ammunition.  As the NVA\u2019s presence was still being sedulously denied, despite it being known to be in Laos in force and to be supplied by the Soviets and Chinese, the remark was considered to be offensive and in bad taste. \n\tI, a non-drinker, was toying with a Pepsi Cola when the Russian accused me of being pro-American.  I answered that I hadn\u2019t thought of it that way.  As I didn\u2019t like champagne there was not a lot of choice.  Vladimir\u2019s answer was conciliatory; \u2018I am neutral.  Look!  Portuguese,\u2019 pointing to his champagne as he emptied his glass.  \u2018I don\u2019t know how to be anything but neutral.\u2019\n\tDonald\u2019s voice rose above the hubbub, \u2018Vladimir, you don\u2019t know anything.  You are a product of the Revolution and were probably born in 1917, weren\u2019t you?\u2019\n\tThe Russian\u2019s blue eyes frosted behind his thick spectacles.\n\t\u2018No, Colonel, in 1916.  I had to prepare myself for the Revolution, like you will have to one day.\u2019\n\tAs the laughter swelled up, he continued loudly; \u2018You don\u2019t know anything yet.\u2019  His eyes were steely and his lips pursed into a pretence of a smile.  \u2018You have it still to come.\u2019\n\tLater, at another party, Vladimir Gretchanine whispered to me, \u2018You know everything, the other man knew nothing.  When you go to Moscow, I will take you,\u2019 then continued talking normally.\n\tAfter a week Donald and his wife flew away.  As I watched the aeroplane disappear over the horizon, I went back to my car, the driver uncovered my official flag and the new British DA was driven back to his office, deep in thought.  I knew my ambassador, John Lloyd, was openly anti-American and violently left-wing in sympathy.  I never fathomed how Authority allowed such a travesty.  As the Americans were paying for and running the war against NVA units dressed in the uniform of the communist Lao, the Pathet Lao, PL, the result for me was that I was initially regarded as untrustworthy as had my predecessor been, by insulting most, if not all, his diplomatic peers.  Unknown to me the Deputy Royal Lao Army (RLA) Commander, Major General Kouprasith Abhay, decided to test me to see where my true loyalties lay.\n\tI knew it would be foolish to start off in anything but a very low key, working from first military principles, a firm base, a workable plan and a reserve.  My firm base had to be my reputation, my method of living and impeccable credentials of exemplary self-conduct.  My workable plan was simple: behave normally, develop contacts locally and in the provinces, noting, observing, thinking, searching \u2013 but for what? \u2013 probing, teasing, assessing, collating, re-assessing, recognising, rejecting, then seeing what was left, all within the confines and constraints of duty, tact and loyalty, never taking anyone or anything for granted.\n\tAnd what of my reserve?  A reserve of what?  I had nothing in the conventional sense.  All I could do was to build up sufficient good will and trust in me, to become known and tolerated, then accepted and finally even sought after \u2013 which did happen.  I knew Europeans regarded me as eccentric but, for Asians, that was all to the good as eccentricity is regarded as a manifestation of inner strength.\n\tOnce I was DA Vientiane (properly pronounced Vieng Chan and meaning \u2018a fortified town in the shape of a [half] moon\u2019) apart from Chinese guerrillas we captured in the jungle, I met Chinese communists for the first time in my life.  How to approach them as well as the Soviets was a worry, too friendlily and I\u2019d be taken as a fellow-traveller, something I decidedly was not; too coldly and I\u2019d never get along with them as I\u2019d have to as part of my job.  I remembered a hungry cat I had once come across.  The first day I threw it some food quite a distance from me: it pounced on it and ran away with it to eat alone.  The next day I threw a morsel of food in its direction but not so far and, by the end of the week, it was so tame it was eating out of my hand.\n\tThat was my method and it seemed to work.  When I visited them officially for the first time, the Soviet, Vladimir Gretchanine, Chinese, Chen Shu-lin and the Pole overwhelmed me with their abundance of alcohol.  The four communist Laos allowed an office in Vientiane offered me squash; all were scrupulously polite.  Fluency in Lao was a great passport to their acceptance as well as my Asian background that no Russian ever seemed to have \u2013 or seemed to want to have.  My favourite was the Filipino, August Derpol, who offered me a cup of Nescaf\u00e9!\n\tThe Lao Generals knew I was a linguist by hobby, a bachelor by bad luck and a tee-totaller by choice \u2013 I had already met General Kouprasith Abhay in England.  I was still only dimly aware what to expect in a country where there were many representatives of The Workers\u2019 Paradise, but I had been warned that such a combination was bound to excite every kind of normal and perverted suspicion in the True Revolutionary\u2019s heart (if indeed a True Revolutionary has a heart).  I was therefore determined to leave nothing to chance.\n\tYet...one evening soon after I had become official, the telephone bell in my villa rang.  \u20182362, Colonel Cross speaking.\u2019  A dulcet and seductive voice cooed back, \u2018\u2019Allo, Colonel...\u2019 but she got no further because I replaced the receiver, searching my mind for clues.  Who?  Why?\n\tA few days later I was called to the front of the embassy where visitors were received and found a charming, coy and demure young local girl awaiting me.  She stood then sat with her knees and heels tightly together (a good parachute landing stance!) and spoke impeccable French.  She said that she understood I was looking for a teacher.  Apart from Jasmine that was not so.  There was something forced about her approach that made me suspicious.  However she offered all that I wanted as far as the three languages I needed, Lao, Thai and Vietnamese were concerned, so I decided to meet her the following evening in my villa \u2013 she already knew where I lived.  Her name was Kaysorn Bouapha. \n\tMy villa boasted a large and formal room downstairs.  Upstairs, there was an open-sided room where I had installed my language books and tapes.  Off the room a passage led to the bedrooms and I was surprised when Kaysorn appeared unannounced and immediately went to inspect all the rooms.  We sat, she so close to me that, had I tried, I could not have put a piece of paper between us.  Not having one I did not try and the situation was obviously going as she had planned it so I said nothing \u2013 anyway, the linguistic niceties were beyond me.  It would sound a little odd to say, \u2018Excuse me, Mademoiselle, but I can\u2019t get any paper between us.\u2019  Some pleasant, but unnecessarily prolonged squirming ensued, and the first lesson started.  Kaysorn found her pupil\u2019s attention wandering.\n\tThe next day she was late, so I got out of my office fig and put on, amongst other items of clothing, a pair of open-ended sandals, thongs.  I sat down in my study to wait and, to my surprise, again she came up the stairs unannounced.  For one as demure as she, her method of approach was unusually vigorous.  Her first ploy was to go into the bathroom, bring out a pair of scissors and attempt to cut my toe nails.  Once more the linguistic niceties eluded me, so the offer was declined by gesture and a flat, \u2018Merci!\u2019  The lesson then proceeded normally, if anything was normal, but the alarm bells were ringing much louder than on Day 1.  I reported this to the correct source in the embassy who asked the American to trace her.\n\tThe general pattern of the lessons was the same but the provocation increased.  The winsome smiles, the uncalled-for compliments and the snooping at my diary made each lesson a challenge of wits and politeness.  I wanted about two more weeks\u2019 instruction from her.  Before then the answer came; it was thought that she was a student of the Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow.  (The American trace was another woman of that name as the suspect.  I was also told to remember that a sleeping dictionary always opened in the same place.)\n\tOne Saturday she turned up without warning and gave me a pair of Thai silk pyjama pants \u2013 which I refused to put on \u2013 and on the next Saturday, to my horror, she again appeared, this time bringing with her a small book wrapped up in coloured paper.  On opening it I saw it was a secret army publication so I gave it back to her, upbraiding her for trying to make me into a spy.  She had also brought some Vietnamese spring rolls with her and, to my utter surprise, rammed one into my mouth before I could stop her.  She drank more wine usual and continued trying to persuade me to make me take the secret publication.\n\tI warned her and sent her away.  A couple of Sundays later I was invited to lunch at the Indian ambassador\u2019s house.  On my return I saw some temple rubbings of Angkor Wat in the hall, brought by whom?  I went upstairs for a change of clothes and a shower, then went into the guest room to turn off the air conditioner.  And there was Kaysorn in bed, her clothes thrown on the floor.\n\tShe pulled back the sheet and she was, nude.  \u2018I\u2019ve brought you two presents, temple rubbings and me\u2019 she mumbled.  I looked at her hungrily for a long minute but my urgency brought no response.  Lust turned to anger, to disgust.\n\tI left her and took my dog Singha for a long walk; it was dusk when we got back.  She had gone.\n\tThere remained the inevitable confrontation when we next met a few days later.  Apart from Kaysorn and her behaviour, nothing else seemed to be going right.  Every time I had gone to the Provinces on my weekly travels I had been met with suspicion, albeit correctly, in every place and every unit I visited.  I felt that by then there should have been some progress in my contacts.  I felt sore, so when I did talk with Kaysorn, my tongue was bitterly sharp, which proved I had been an apt pupil, despite the distractions.\n\tSo she left my employment but that had not solved the problem of who was running her.  I thought it would be one of the many things that I would never be any the wiser about.  I continued my weekly travels, delighted that there was now a sea-change in my reception everywhere I went, everything everywhere smiling and full of information.\n\tSome time later there was an official meeting of Heads of Mission from South Vietnam and the Khmer Republic, as Cambodia was then known, along with the representative accredited to the Mayor of Hanoi as Britain did not have diplomatic relations with North Vietnam.  A party was held in the Residency garden of the British embassy, to which the British Ambassador had invited all four Pathet Lao representatives but very few right-wing guests.  One of the latter was the Deputy-Commander of the RLA.  I had met him in his office several times and I went up to him as he stood by himself in the shadows as his main host had deliberately ignored him all evening, to offer him another drink.  He declined the offer but continued talking so softly that only I could hear; \u2018I sent her.  We trust you.  You have passed the test.\u2019\n91***\nWhen the Head of the ISCS was Brigadier A.H.E. Michigan of the Indian Army, we became close friends.  He told me that he commanded the operation in 1972 when the Indian Army invaded East Pakistan after the monsoon.  Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister, had toured the world not long before the invasion telling foreign governments how heinous were the West Pakistanis in East Pakistan and that, if matters did not improve, \u2018something would have to be done.\u2019\n\tIt seems that she was believed but the Brigadier told me that at the end of the previous cold weather the units that were going to be parachuted into East Pakistan sent all their officers and junior non-coms, as tourists, to recce the dropping zones.  Everyone, except for the invaders, was completely fooled.  East Pakistan soon became Bangladesh.\n92***\nThe first journey I made before the \u2018test\u2019 in the embassy Beaver to the royal capital, Luang Prabang, eighty minutes\u2019 flying time away, where I was due to meet the commander of MR 1.  The journey was to be broken at Vang Vieng, base of the right-wing Neutralists, on the northern rim of the Vientiane plain.\n\tWe took off from Wattay airport, so shrouded by dust and haze in the dry weather that two planes landing at the same time from either end was not unknown.  Our take-off was in the clear and soon large jungle-covered hills with perpendicular limestone cliffs floated up and curved round to greet us as we approached the runway at Vang Vieng.  I was startled to see a line of some twenty men on the town side of the strip, all dressed in a uniform of sorts.  We taxied over to the near side of the airfield and the pilot cut the engine.  The end figure became detached from the rest, came over and introduced himself as the Colonel in charge of the Neutralist Vang Vieng Military District.  Would I like to come and be introduced to his staff?  It seemed that everybody who was anybody, and some who were not, were there.  As well as military officers, I was to meet the police, a large contingent from the civil administration and a schoolmaster \u2013 all were Neutralists, so I was given to understand as I was escorted towards them.  I went down the line, shaking everybody\u2019s hand, looking at each of them straight between the eyes, a smile and a word of greeting and thanks for their welcome.\n\tI was escorted a short way down the road and led into a wooden-hutted military camp that housed the HQ of the Neutralists.  These were not part of the main army, calling themselves by a French title; Forces Arm\u00e9es Neutralistes.  To my further surprise they all, including the schoolmaster, mounted the steps of a building and sat down on seats arranged around an impressive but probably inaccurate situation map.  A military briefing followed, general and anodyne, at the end of which various statistics were given, including, to my amazement, the farm animal population of the entire district, down to the last chicken.  Had I any questions?  My mind raced with wanting to know many details.  How was it that so many outsiders could be included in the presumably confidential briefing?  Who formulated Neutralist policy and what was the chain of command?  How did they manage for operational clearance on their boundaries with the Royal Lao Air Force, RLAF?  Who had counted the chickens? \u2013 but, apart from checking some of their figures, said no, I hadn\u2019t any as the briefing had been lucid and comprehensive and I was still so new that I had nothing against which to compare it.  Maybe another time?\n\tI sensed their relief at my not wanting any more details and, after a pause, a cup of heavily sweetened black coffee and a glass of almost colourless lukewarm tea were offered and a few minutes passed in pleasantries.  After allowing enough opportunity for my hosts to take the conversational initiative, I looked at my watch and rose.  I glanced round the room and tried to read their faces but their expressions were as bland and empty as had been their briefing.  But could I expect anything else at this first meeting and what could I offer them except the courtesy of my presence which, to them, showed that the British government still rated the Neutralists separately?\n\t(When I told the French DA about my visit he said that he had stopped there to relieve nature, was set upon by three young women and debagged in mid-stream so losing his dignity as the French DA.  Apart from him and his staff there were some French Military Missions, MMF, chiefly for training, allowed by the 1962 Geneva Accords for Laos.)\n\tThe reaction of one Neutralist officer to being promoted to command a battalion after he had been voted by popular acclaim at what the charitable might call a promotion conference.  The aspiring commander demurred.  He told me that he had asked for a year on the staff in Vientiane first as he wanted to see the bright lights.  This was not allowed and he was told to go and take over his unit straightaway.  However, he did not go until fifteen days later, only after the old commanding officer had left.  \u2018It might have embarrassed him had we been there together,\u2019 he explained.\n*\nStandards of military honesty were mutable.  A Lao colonel reported to his American colleague that he wanted to transfer from the Irregulars back to the RLA.  (Monthly pay of a soldier was the same as airmail postage of one letter I wrote to England.)  When reminded that the pay in the former was higher in the latter, his reply was that he was only getting ten percent of his soldiers\u2019 pay but were he to transfer back he could get twenty percent, thus he would be richer.  \u2018To get him to talk openly about it shows how honest he is,\u2019 his American colleague told me.\n*\nBut back to my journey to MR 1: after forty minutes we landed at Luang Prabang where we were met and driven a short distance into the town and up a short incline.  I was invited to meet the Chief of Staff, \u2018who speaks no English, before meeting the MR commander, Brigadier General Chao Savang, the King\u2019s half-brother, who also speaks no English.\u2019\n\tI was led to an office where the Chief of Staff, a small fleshy man, was sitting at an empty table, looking bored.  As the General was the King\u2019s half-brother, I wanted to know whether I addressed him as Altesse, Excellence or G\u00e9n\u00e9ral.  I was told Mon G\u00e9n\u00e9ral was all I needed to say and to treat him like any other senior officer.\n\tWe went into the General\u2019s office, a small, dim room, with a large wall map hidden by a green curtain.  At the table to the left of the room sat a large, squat, heavily-built man, who got up when I went over to the table and saluted him.  He put out his large paw to be shaken and mumbled something inaudible.  I was invited by the Chief of Staff to sit down at the opposite end of the room.  A silence followed.  I, using strictly protocol French, thanked the General for the courtesy of allowing me the privilege to come, as the new British attach\u00e9, and pay my respects.  Another silence followed.  The General stared at me and I saw his mouth open but discerned no noise.  The silence continued.  The Chief of Staff looked at the General, then at me.  The General, with the slow movement of senescence or of debility, pressed a button on his desk and the Captain came in, went to the map, drew back the curtain and gave a briefing.  There was no mention of the Irregulars, of which MR 1 was full, nor of Thais, who were also represented in fair strength.  There was, however, a surprising amount of detail on numbers of NVA, PL and Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s road-building troops.  As I listened to the list of figures, I wondered if they bore any relation to the Neutralists\u2019 chickens.\n\tOn the map was a road marked in red leading out of Laos to Dien Bien Phu in Vietnam and, looking at it suddenly made everything more real, especially as the fighting was much nearer than the road.  I was not invited to ask any questions and there was another eloquent hush.  I could not make out whether the General\u2019s reticence was due to a sore throat, a hangover, boredom or shyness.  The briefing had included the still unfamiliar American and French army terminology and that, combined with the confusingly tongue-twisting Laotian names I had been subjected to, the heavily accented French, to say nothing of the pregnant silences \u2013 or were they merely stillborn? \u2013 and the fact that I was neither to be taken to any combat position nor to visit any soldiers, made the visit to HQ MR 1 unspectacular, unexciting and memorable only in its utter banality.\n\tThe visit to MR 3 was even less useful that it was at Vang Vieng, fish farms rather than chickens, but at MR 4 Brigadier General Soutchai, an American \u2018in-put\u2019, was lucid and worthy of his appointment.  It was during his briefing that I realised the interesting parts of what was happening were the ones never spoken about.\n93***\nI was indeed lucky to have the embassy Beaver aircraft at my disposal and both pilots I had were superb.  I visited over sixty places in Laos, almost all in the Beaver.  Certain areas were restricted to us because of USAF intervention (B-52 and F-111 strikes) or artillery being used in the ground fighting.  Going to the northwest of the country meant flying over Thai territory, which could be dangerous as the Royal Thai Air Force could be trigger-happy despite clearance having been obtained.  Flying direct over where the Chinese army had brought anti-aircraft artillery to defend Route 46, running from Yunnan to Pak Lay, south of the River Mekong, was out of the question.  Chinese Army engineers were then upgrading it.  A civil aircraft had been shot down not all that long before.  It had been covered with soil to prevent aerial photography.  Permission for the Americans to photograph it was, somehow, obtained from Peking through the good offices of the British and, so the story went, an American plane was sent to do this.  The crew was on tenterhooks.  The pilot contacted the ground and, forgetting that he was still through to them, said over the crew intercom that he hoped the \u2018little yellow bastards won\u2019t shoot us down.\u2019  He was startled to hear a disembodied voice squawk from the earphones \u2018You velly lude man, one time lound only.\u2019\n94***\nI contacted Princess Jasmine and she gave me an hour\u2019s lesson.  The next time I visited her house she told me I was well known in high circles but I had yet to visit the Defence Minister, Sisouk na Champassac.  Before I went to meet him I told the ambassador where I was going.  \u2018Oh, he is a hawk and mad but go if you must\u2019 was his peevish answer.\nI had arranged a visit with difficulty: Sisouk was Minister of Finance in the morning and only of Defence in the afternoon.  My time to meet him was 10 o\u2019clock, so that meant the Finance Ministry.  Wrong, so I was late.\n\tI apologised for being late and his first remark was \u2018Your ambassador is a pacifist and mad.\u2019  My answer was \u2018Thank you, Your Excellency, for saying that.  There is now no need to mention it again.\u2019  I hoped that I, personally, was unscathed and uncontaminated.  Yes.\n\tHe was interested in what I had done militarily and asked me if I had been to PS 18 and Whisky 3.  On learning of my ignorance he muttered something about early days and dismissed me, saying that we\u2019d meet again.\n\tOn the morning of my next meeting I learnt of the cocktail party gossip of the night before and that Sisouk had divorced his French wife and was to marry Jasmine.  As soon as I entered his office he got up from behind his desk, came round to me and burst out excitedly that he was going to get married soon.  Did I know?  I feigned ignorance and offered my congratulations.  I was motioned to sit down and he sat opposite me.  I was asked to guess who his wife-to-be was.\n\t\u2018That is a most difficult question, Your Excellency,\u2019 I started and went on to say that if I were looking for someone who matched his social status, was beautiful, had character, was good with all types of people, knew how to talk well, could speak English and French, knew when to keep silent, would be a companion at home, could discuss matters with him, had a sense of humour \u2013 here I racked my brains to think of any other attribute not already mentioned \u2013 wouldn\u2019t mind if he had important people to look after at a moment's notice, \u2018um, I think the only person I know who could measure up to all that is Princess Jasmine.\u2019\n\tThe effect was dramatic.  Sisouk got up, came round to me and shook my hand. \u2018You\u2019ve guessed my secret, you\u2019ve guessed my secret,\u2019 he burbled happily.  I waited a bit and then he asked me if I yet been to PS 18 and Whisky 3.  I told him I had not and that I still had no idea what or where they were.  \u2018Tell the Commander-in-Chief General Bounphone that he can take you there with him at any time.\u2019  I felt I was so near to a breakthrough that I had the temerity to ask Sisouk if he would personally tell the General as it would save much bother.\n\tHe took the suggestion and told his personal assistant to send for the General, there and then . There was a discreet knock on the door and the lard-covered General, known to the Americans as Jubilation, came in.  I stood up and saluted him.  He came over and punched me in the chest with a throaty cry of \u2018Commando!\u2019.  Sisouk bade him sit down and told him to take me to the guerrilla units at PS [Pakse (landing) Site] 18 and Whisky [I never knew why] 3 and that I had carte blanche to go anywhere at all in Laos with him.  I thanked Sisouk most sincerely and the C-in-C took me away to his office for another talk.\n\tIn his office Bounphone told me frankly that he thought I would do much better on my own, going on to say that people did not show him everything and I knew what to look for and what to say.  People were intrigued by my background and what he would like was that I came and told him if I found anything I thought he ought to know about after touring these places.  And who said that that fickle lady, Dame Fortune, never smiled?\n95***\nOn one road journey through a refugee village I saw that the road was the children\u2019s playground.  I had always admired the way Asian children could play anywhere; the slums of Bombay, the backwoods of Borneo, the mountains of Nepal and here, with utter unconcern of the world around them.  Their toys were stones and sand, bits of brick and wood, water and earth: nothing to go wrong and nothing that went wrong, so unlike their spoilt and pampered European counterparts\u2019 generosity of gadgetry and superfluity of sophistication, with subsequent frustration accompanied by peeved tantrums when the inevitable breakages happened.  Was this one of the underlying reasons why Asians, masters since childhood of improvisation, were so hard to beat in the context of guerrilla warfare in jungle terrain?  A fascinating theory, I mused, as we gathered momentum, leaving the village behind.\n96***\nThe Swiss gave two tons of Fondue cheese to the refugees who threw it away as \u2018the soap didn\u2019t lather\u2019.\n97***\nOn 20 August 1973, the day a new British Ambassador, Mr Alan Davidson and his American wife, arrived by boat over the River Mekong from Thailand, there was an attempted right-wing coup which was all over by midday.  It was a dismal failure \u2013 a coup manqu\u00e9 \u2013 the non-event of the year.  Most of the two hunded and fifty-odd dissidents who took part managed to fade away.  Those who were caught were believed to have been shot, despite whatever other reports were issued.\n\tA typically Laotian touch was added on the following night: a number of dissidents who had successfully fled over the river to Thailand crossed back to claim their pay and were promptly arrested. \n\tWhat was as rare was Lloyd\u2019s replacement arriving only eight days after Lloyd had gone and, rarer still, credentials were to be presented within three days.  It was almost as though Britain was apologising for the past man and the RLG was signalling its understanding.  The communist LPF was uninterested.\n\tThree days later Davidson and his senior staff flew up to Luang Prabang and met up with a member of the Protocol Department, who had flown up the day before to arrange the ceremony with the palace officials.  Travelling in the same RLAF Dakota were the staff and our food (bought in Bangkok) for the British party who were to be accommodated in the government hotel that was only used on special occasions.\n\tAlthough billed to leave the hotel at 10 o\u2019clock for an 11 o\u2019clock audience, by a quarter past 10 nothing had come to fetch us and we started to fret.  The telephone was out of order.  I told a couple of battered taxis outside to remain in case they were needed.  It had been a struggle for the embassy staff to get dressed in time and the ambassador found his medal ribbon bar loose.  I was called in to organise its repair which, after much cajoling, was affected by a prettily winsome Lao chambermaid.\n\tAt ten to 11, to everybody\u2019s relief, three protocol cars and four police outriders drove up.  The fact that we had been given a time an hour earlier than necessary disconcerted the protocol officer and the King\u2019s ADC not one whit \u2013 bor pen nyang\u2013  we were ready, weren\u2019t we?  We were driven off, police outriders\u2019 sirens shrieking and red lights flashing.  As the cars stopped at the palace a guard of red-trousered, white-coated soldiers saluted.  Out we got and ascended the steps of the ornate waiting chamber.  Hats and gloves were taken from us.  We passed remarks in subdued tone, the atmosphere a trifle tense.  The large doors were open to a passage, across which thick curtains hid the throne room.\n\t\u2018Will you come this way please, Gentlemen,\u2019 a court orderly asked us, in French.  We formed up in single file to enter the presence.  Alan Davidson was in front, flanked by a protocol officer and a Ministry of Foreign Affairs man.  Robin Fearn, Head of Chancery, flanked by two court officials, followed him.  The rest of us were solo.  When we were ready, the curtain was drawn back to reveal His Majesty, King Savang Vatthana \u2013 an indefatigable, gentle and cultured man \u2013 sitting on his throne with the Crown Prince, Le Prince H\u00e9ritier, to his rear right.  The Queen was not there.  We all bowed, moved forward six paces, bowed again and waited for the King to stand up.  Davidson asked the King if he might have permission to present his credentials.  Permission was given.  Davidson walked another three paces towards the throne, bowed, took out his prepared speech and began to read his message of loyalty in a firm voice.  He handed the King two letters, both addressed to H.M. The King of Laos, and two flunkeys bearing two silver ba\u00e7i bowls, moved to the King who put both letters (I know one of them started, \u2018Sire, my brother\u2019) in one bowl, took his address and his spectacles out of the other.  The King read his own address in a low voice, gave back paper and specs to the flunkey and took three paces forward.  He shook hands with the new ambassador, congratulating him, and they talked for several minutes.\n\t\u2018May I introduce my staff, Your Majesty?\u2019\n\t\u2018S\u2019il vous voulez.\u2019\n\tThat over, we went out in reverse gear, I careful not to trip on my sword scabbard.  We were given a vin d\u2019honneur.  We signed the Golden Book, le livre d\u2019or, and went outside for photographs.  By then three platoons of soldiers had been formed up as a Guard of Honour, complete with our two countries\u2019 flags.  We stood to attention while the national anthems were played.  The new ambassador received a salute and was asked permission for the soldiers to dismiss once we had walked past them.  We shook hands with the palace staff and motored back to the hotel with our police escort, sirens shrieking and red lights flashing.\n98***\nThe communist press reviled the wedding of Sisouk and Jasmine.  The bride looked ravishing, dressed in a pale blue, long-sleeved blouse, made of silk with floral designs.  Her skirt was dark blue with golden embroidery in the shape of diamonds.  She wore thick gold bangles and a long, thin, red-gold necklace that was curled twice around her neck and, bandolier-fashion, twice around her body.  A shawl, also dark blue, had the diamond motif in golden-red thread.  It was nine inches across and was draped from in front, round over the left shoulder, under the right arm and back over the left shoulder.  It ended in the form of a net.  On her head was a strange hat of cupola mode made of red cloth studded with gold and with a golden band around it.  The hat rose some six inches about her head and was topped in a rounded bobble.\n\tThe bridegroom looked equally striking.  He wore a lavender blue silk coat with a high collar.  In front were six golden buttons.  Round his waist was a two-inch-wide belt of golden cloth with diamond-shaped golden buckles.  He also wore two golden chains, one over his left shoulder and under his right arm, the other over his right shoulder and under his left arm.  Both chains had the diamond motif around the top and bottom of his high collar and around his sleeves.  For trousers he wore normal baggy national dress that tied up in a tail under the belt at the back below the jacket and came three-quarters the way down his legs.  He was bareheaded.  Both wore European-style shoes; hers golden, his black.\n\tBut for me the nicest part of it all was that Princess Golden Fairy flew out from London and we got on even better than before.  Later a Colonel Somneuk Siharaj offered to be an intermediary for us to marry.\n\tLater it was decided to give a hundred and one returning prisoners of war a medal in honour of the wedding.  The Director of Operations, General Oudone Sananikone, was worried as a crisis had arisen.  The Director did not know which of two awards were to be given and, even if it was decided which was the more suitable, there were not enough of either sort to go round.  Sisouk himself was already thirty minutes late in coming to present them.  Oudone asked me if I\u2019d like to go and talk with the ex-POWs until the ceremony started.  I jumped at the opportunity and accompanied him where they were lined up.  The General turned to me and said, disarmingly and inaccurately, that I knew everything and understood everything better than they did.\n\tBy then I had become almost immune from the curiosities of Laotian life, almost but not quite.  I thought of the staid British method of the award of decorations, the \u2018looser\u2019 American system and the nonchalant gong-grabbing French who boasted they never knew how many medals they had, but for sheer, unadulterated military inefficiency, this seemed to put all else in the shade.\n\tThe ex-POWs may well have regarded me as an exotic appendage to the ceremony as I walked down the two ranks, shaking hands with and saying something to them all, and making some of them laugh.  Sisouk arrived as I was finishing and the solution to the problem was apt: each row got a different medal, the front rank the lower grade but given out by the senior man and the rear rank the higher, given by the junior.  Neat.\n99***\nI asked General Kouprasith why it was raining so unseasonably for December.  \u2018Because there are two Augusts this year,\u2019 he said, in a tone of voice usually reserved for children who have not done their homework.\n100***\nOn the evening of Thursday, 11 October, 1974, an LPF car drove into my villa. Compound.  Unusually there was only one man in the back.  He got out and told me that the Neutralisation Contingent was to begin its airlift from Hanoi next morning and the first two planes were due to land at Wattay at 10 o'clock.  \u2018Please, as the Co-Chairman's military representative, come to the airport and see them in.\u2019\n\tI said of course I would.  The LPF man refused any refreshment and I bade him goodbye.  As I entered my house the telephone rang and it was the French Defence Attach\u00e9, Jean Labouchiex.  Was his English colleague going to the airport?  Would the representative of Her Gracious Britannic Majesty go round by way of the French embassy so they could go together?  Oui.  Merci.  A bient\u00f4t.\n\tAll was abuzz at 10 o'clock at Wattay airport the next morning.  The visitors\u2019 gallery was full and, on the forecourt of the terminal building, a large crowd of communists had gathered: apart from the LPF there were Russians, Chinese, North Vietnamese, Poles, Czechs and the Soviet-leaning neutral Indian Head of the ICSC.\n\tThe Frenchman and I were the only two non-communist Europeans.  Jean Labouchiex had orders to represent the Common Market \u2013 a bizarre idea \u2013 and keep with me but, being protocol-minded, was sulking as he had been in Laos longer than had I.  I was in uniform but he was in plain clothes with a homburg hat pulled over his eyes and a shabby mackintosh, remindingd me of an out-of-work jobbing gardener.  As the sole representatives of the so-called Western world, we don't make a particularly inspiring couple, I thought.\n\tBy a quarter to 11 no planes had arrived and people were starting to look at their watches.  The word spread that the time announced the previous day was not for the planes landing but the time the first of the two aircraft was due to take off from Hanoi (the strip at Sam Neua was too small) where the Neutralisation Contingents had mustered for processing before flying down south.\n\tAt a quarter to twelve a cry went up as the noise of an aeroplane was heard and five minutes later a Soviet AN-21 landed and taxied to as near the terminal building as it could. The propellers stopped and the crowd surged forward and a policeman tried to prevent people from getting too close.\n\tThe rear compartment opened, revealing rope-bound stores.  A full five minutes elapsed before the side door opened and two PL guards emerged, blinking, to the top of the portable steps, completely unnerved and unprepared for the heroes' welcome they were getting.  They quickly popped back inside.  The cheering stopped.  There was an incongruous and unrealistic air about it all.\n\tTurning to Jean Laboucheix I told him to look at the crowd.  I saw them as a flock of mechanical sheep.  They were told to cheer the first plane in so they cheered the rice or whatever the stores were and the sentries.  The powers that be in the north could have made an impression of efficiency but, no, they preferred to muddle along with bureaucratic ineptitude.  They paid lip service to social democracy as being the people\u2019s wish but when it came to the crunch and the people would wish something with a touch of panache, what happened but a shambles?  Among that group of representatives, only our two countries were enlightened enough to be able to have the political elasticity to withstand and accommodate to the pressures of what the majority wanted. \u2018That should be what the word \u201cdemocracy\u201d means.  This disorganised bumbledom and political mockery is a far cry from anything like that,\u2019 I finished up.\n\tBefore the Frenchman could answer my unusually long and uncharacteristically bitter diatribe, a voice lashed me from behind.  \u2018Colonel, the quicker you stop meddling in politics and stick to counting soldiers the better.\u2019  I wheeled round and saw the Czech Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires angrily pointing an index finger at me.  He said he felt insulted by what I had said, claiming that his country was a democracy also.\n\tI brashly answered that there were democracies and democracies.  It was interesting to ask what sort of democracy any country really was when it was recalled that the only time there was true democracy was in ancient Greece where they had slaves. \u2018The cynic will say that the only true democracy we can find is in an ants\u2019 nest.\u2019  (I have since forgotten the French for \u2018an ants\u2019 nest\u2019.)\n\tA stony silence followed.  The Frenchman\u2019s lips pursed a silent \u2018bravo\u2019 and the Czech said something I did not catch.  I realised I was getting nowhere at all letting off steam and upsetting such people.  I had not appreciated what effect this crowd of gibbering puppets I was with would have on me.  But realise I must, and quickly, as the AN-21 standing in front of me on the tarmac represented a turn of the page of history, without fanfare, without flourish.  The victors were here and now in the capital city of the vanquished \u2013 despite all the material and other advantages the Free World, as it called itself, had poured into the armoury and coffers of the vanquished.  I had read Street Without Joy, the book written about the French defeat in 1954.  The AN-21 was merely the conventional, modern client-carrier of the unchanged, unconventional tactics and tenacity of only a generation ago.  Let there be no mistake about that.\n\tIt may have been then that the truth about the way the communists operate was finally brought home to me: the truth is that there is no truth, or rather that untruth is used as a weapon on a scale that we in the West do not seem to realise.  It is wrong, indeed, to turn round, certainly in public and often even in private, and say that all communists are liars.  Nevertheless, after repeated pronouncements at one level produced completely different situations on the ground, it was hard to draw any other conclusion except that the Great Lie was as great a weapon as any other \u2013 and greater than most.  It was for that reason that anything one such as I could provide to help those in London solve the jigsaw puzzle of communist intentions was so important.\n\tSwallow your pride, you fool, you are now in the enemy\u2019s camp for all intents and purposes, I told myself.  I turned to the Czech.  \u2018Your Excellency, you are quite right.  From now on it will be the soldiers getting out of the next AN-21 that I count.\u2019  Thoughts were too private for the freedom of venting as though they were public.  I\u2019d also have been wiser to have checked who was listening to me before announcing my political theories.  That day was a good one to start such a precaution in earnest.\n\tThe Czech seemed suitably mollified.  He moved off and left us alone.  The Frenchman congratulated me with a Gallic shrug.  Banalities ensued as we waited for the second plane to arrive.  The troop-carrying AN-21 came in forty minutes after the first but it was an anti-climax.  Of seventy-eight passengers, seven were women.  The men wore civilian clothes or uniforms of a nondescript green in equal numbers, representing functionaries and soldiers, however those not carrying Kalashnikov rifles or Makarov pistols were believed to be policemen.  Counting these people as they streamed by had a mesmerising effect.\n\tAt a quarter to one I dropped Jean Labouchiex off at his embassy and went back to my villa to take the dog for a hard walk to work my frustrations out of my system.\n101***\nI only spoke twice without thinking: one was with the Czech Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires whose feelings I had hurt when the Pathet Lao came to neutralise Vientiane.  I had an altercation with Chen Shu-lin, later on in the month when he paid me a visit.  He always came with his French-speaking interpreter, never with the Lao-speaker.\n\tI was on the embassy steps waiting for the two men.  I led them through the foyer, along the corridor and into my small office that only had two comfortable chairs.  I invited him to sit in one of them and his interpreter in the other.  I had the choice of sitting behind my desk or on it, legs dangling: I chose the latter.\n\tChen suddenly asked me what I thought of the Arab-Israeli war.  I told Chen that I hated it when any larger country bullied a smaller one: Egypt and Syria against Israel, India versus East Pakistan and, unthinkingly, China against Tibet.  The effect of such a tactless remark was instantaneously obvious.\n\tThere followed a twenty-minute tirade.  Chen held his head low and severely berated me, petulantly, keeping his voice subdued.  After a while I felt that much of what was being said was for future use as far as the interpreter was concerned.  He was, after all, an intelligence officer and even were he not, righteous indignation had to be shown.  No communists were ever at peace amongst themselves.\n\t\u2018I came to be friendly but you are showing unfriendliness.  Why do you have to raise this question?\u2019\n\t\u2018It wasn\u2019t a question but an answer: an example if you like.\u2019\n\t\u2018If you are not friendly I\u2019ll get up and go.  I won\u2019t come to your party you have asked me to if you are in such an unfriendly frame of mind.\u2019\n\t\u2018That\u2019s up to you,\u2019 I said, wishing I had not been so impetuous and now bored with his tantrum.\n\t\u2018How can you say, and here the word that had offended was at last uttered, spat out almost, Tibet is not China?\u2019\n\t\u2018Of course it is different; different customs, different clothes, different language, different religion.  Surely that\u2019s enough to start with?\u2019\n\tBreathlessly not missing any opportunity to gain a point, this last remark was countered by \u2018Religion?  Religion?  How about Northern Ireland?\u2019\n\t\u2018Sure.  How about Northern Ireland?  Our Prime Minister has said that it\u2019s up to the people.  If they want to stay where and how they are, they can.  If they want to join the South, they can.  They've got the choice.  Seems to me we're more for the people than you lot are.\u2019\n\tChen, jowls aquiver, rose up angrily from his chair, took two paces towards me, drew back his arm and swung it forward to slap my face.  Before the stroke connected he tried to withdraw his hand, realising the enormity of his action.  In vain: the impetus was too much and his outstretched hand hit my cheek, though not at all hard.  He sprang back, appalled by what he had done.  I made no move.  I sat there, smiling at the, by now, thoroughly confused Chinese.  \u2018I came to be friendly\u2026\u2019 he said, stopping in mid-sentence.  The interpreter, hawk-eyed, watched us both.\n\tI saw a collision course and decided to steer away.  I put out my hand.  \u2018I\u2019m sorry if I overstated my case.  Forget it.\u2019  We shook hands: relief shone from Chen\u2019s face and calm was restored.  He left soon afterwards and, as we bade our farewells on the steps of the embassy, all seemed normal.  I realised it was a stupid thing to have said but, paradoxically, by having slapped my face, the Chinese had lost face \u2013 on points.  He made up for it by telling me, in January 1974, that the Chinese had captured five Soviet spies under a bridge in Peking, a week before the news broke; and the Chinese government\u2019s congratulations to Mrs Thatcher on being elected leader of the Tory party.  I passed both points on to London, but the embassy diplomatic staff discounted both, as it was not they who had been told.  Later Chen warned me that the visit of the Labour Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, to Moscow was a danger to Britain.\n102***\nOn 12 February 1974 four of us from the British embassy went to Sam Neua, the LPF stronghold, at the long-delayed invitation of its Central Committee.  Everything in the communist world seems, at least on the surface, to be done by committee.  Since the last Frenchman left Sam Neua on 3 April 1953, there had been one occasion when the non-communist world had been invited there, the British some ten years previously.\n\tSam Neua is a small provincial town on Route 6 in the northeast of Laos not far from the Vietnamese border.  Too far to be administered from Vientiane, it used to be within the sphere of the French authorities in Hanoi.\n\tWhen it was decided that the left-wing element of the Laotian nationalist movement should go it alone, Sam Neua was chosen for a base.  It had the geographical advantages of being within easy striking distance of Hanoi and being far enough away from the royal and commercial capitals in Laos for communications to be tenuous.  When massive American air attacks laid waste acres of surrounding territory it had the tremendous advantage of providing bombproof shelters as it was in limestone cliff country riddled with caves.  Inside them it was tedious, uncomfortable and cheerless, dank, damp and dreary, but life could still continue with little damage to the LPF cause.  Indeed, it often enhanced it.  Eastern Europeans, subservient to the Soviets, meddling Cubans and fence-sitting Swedes all saw the many surrounding bomb craters, some of which were later used as fish farms, and the shattered remains of Sam Neua town as sure and encouraging signs of little people being bullied by a vicious and wicked superpower, and emerging triumphant.\n\tMilitary London wanted me to keep my ears and eyes open about a number of diverse matters: numbers and types of equipments, vehicles, weapons; state of bridges, roads and runways; state of alertness, morale and training of the officers and soldiers (if I could tell them apart); storage capacity for fuel; medical and hospital facilities; generating capacity, as well as anything else that might be of conceivable military interest.\n\tOn arrival we drove along a dusty road, past bomb craters and wrecked vehicles, troops marching in formed bodies, defensive positions and barbed wire.  The road wound up towards a narrow pass between two limestone precipices towering above us.  We got out and were taken up a path to a great cliff, walked round a vast stone baffle \u2013 a yard and a half thick and thirty feet high \u2013 that was shielding the entrance of a cave that was to be our home.  It was uncomfortably cold inside.\n\tThere was nothing to do that first day.  It was cold and boring inside, not so cold and boring outside, where we were allowed to walk a couple of hundred yards in one direction, always guarded.  The discussions the next day were stilted and at times bordered on farce.  Any point of substance Davidson asked, such as plans for elections, policy for the religious minorities, the transfer of any prisoners of war, zonal boundary markers, composition of government, their concept of neutrality, use of and payment for the Co-Chairmanship, these and many more were parried with inanities.  Why, for instance, had the Vientiane side kidnapped one of their men when he had stopped behind a bush pour faire pipi, why had an RLA soldier been rude to one of their men and why had the Vientiane side repeatedly violated the cease-fire agreement and the accords?  It was heavy-handed and puerile.\n\tForeign troops (Thais, Vietnamese and Chinese) and American advisers were mentioned once \u2013 suggestion, protest, accusation, denial and studied ignorance filled the air.  Each side knew that the other side had a valid point and knew that the other side knew.  For our hosts it was a struggle between their being converted communists, so telling lies as second nature, and natural Lao imbued by their two age-old precepts of survival: behave well to your enemies of today as they may be your friends of tomorrow and be wary of your friends of today as they may be your enemies of tomorrow; bend and you survive, break and you die.  (A third seemed to be never do today what you can put off till the morrow or get someone else to do for you.)\n\tA visit to the hospital that afternoon was cancelled (\u2019no electricity\u2019) so we were taken to the cave that held the shop.  On the way there I hung back and spoke to some of the soldiers who seemed delighted to be spoken to.\n\tI was asked what fraternal country did I come from and when I said I was English I could see that, for them, that was only a language.  They did not associate \u2018English\u2019 with a country.  That started them talking.  I learnt that they were not allowed to marry before they were twenty-seven years old; that, in their early twenties, they had been in uniform for about eight years; that they did not draw pay.  By then my absence from the group was noticed and a functionary came hurrying back to take me away.  The light of interest in the young men\u2019s eyes died.\n\tIn the shop some soldiers were deciding which of the shoddy goods they could have in exchange for their good-conduct vouchers: shoes, writing materials, books, a few items of clothes, torches \u2013 not much else.\n\tSome senior members of the central committee joined us at our evening meal.  The talk at table was in French except for an aside to me, in Lao, by the man on my left, that they had been afraid of me because I spoke Lao but had had good reports of my impartiality so had realised that we could help Laotian unification.  That was why we had been invited.\n\tWe were then taken across to the cave opposite, the Central Committee cave, for a cultural show.  The audience was already seated and gave us a slow handclap as we were ushered in.  Above the stage a large banner proclaimed the LPF\u2019s slogan; \u2018peace, independence, neutrality, democracy, unity, progress\u2019.\n\tSongs were stereotype communist party propaganda, with catchy and lilting tunes, and politically slanted words.  There were p\u00e6ns of praise to their great victories over the American imperialists and the shooting down of aeroplanes by ordinary soldiers, eulogies to the heroics of the peasants and the fraternal aid of their socialist allies.  There were dances by beautifully dressed young girls who sang about \u2018welcoming solidarity at local government level\u2019 and that \u2018the brightest star in the red sky is the signing of the peace accords\u2019.  One song had verses that praised the new spelling for the national language and another glorified elections.  I remembered the spontaneous songs of love and separation, happiness and village scenes that the Gurkhas sang, so lively and vivid, \n\t\t\tWith laughter do I dream my dream/While wide awake I weep;\n\t\t\tMy love is far away it seems/Our tryst we cannot keep;\n\t\t\tThe snow-capped Hills, the peacocks\u2019s screams/Atre all of life a part;\n\t\t\tIn waking hours and in my dreams/My love you sole my heart.\nwas one of the more melancholy but a favourite of mine, not this dreary nonsense.  Songs were the one way that sentiments near to the hearts of all could be the property of all, taken for granted but part of the fabric of everyday life, listened to if not actually sung by the World and his Wife, not this weary muck.\n\tIt was then our turn to dance.  I saw that one of the dancers was the girl who had performed in an LPF film I had seen in Vientiane.  During the dancing I went up to her and told her I had liked it but that I liked the real thing better.  Demurely she lowered her eyelids in maidenly pleasure.\n\tThe whole evening\u2019s performance was an exercise in surface-skating protocol; not too little, not too much \u2013 reminiscent of Buddhist philosophy and a once-famous advertisement for shaving soap!\n\tThe next and last morning we had a stiff, formal meeting with the Red Prince and some members of the politburo.  Davidson told the Red Prince that although we were a small embassy we were good.  He turned, pointed at me and said that I was the only attach\u00e9 who spoke Lao, who got out and talked to the people and so we, the British, understood the real feelings of the people.  The Prince smiled and said Ah, le polyglot.  Photographs were taken.\n\t\tThe thought struck me forcibly that the middle-piece cadres in the \u2018Liberated Zone\u2019 were entirely devoted to the Cause, if only because they had never known any other.  Like millions of other featureless functionaries throughout the world, they were doomed to the treadmill-like monotony of constantly coping with trivia despite the grandiose eloquence of superiority every system sired.\n\tThe meeting was over in an hour.  We took our leave and drove to the outskirts of what had once been a thriving provincial capital.  Here we were allowed to move around and take any photographs we wanted.  Not a house standing, nor was any habitable.  Strangely the wat was the least badly damaged building and therein was a saffron-robed bonze.  Outside were some soldiers and, in the knowledge that I was away soon, I was particularly cheerful when talking to them.  I made them laugh.  A casual observer might have thought such fraternisation unworthy of the occasion but would have been wrong: the mere ability of someone from the western world, vilified though it constantly was by communist propaganda, to make free, easy, sincere and uncensored contact with the young of the other bloc, and without another to check what was being said, was worth many hours of indirect propaganda.  And anyway, it was the leaders and not the led that imposed the deadeningly bleak, unsmiling face of unimaginative officialdom everywhere.\n103***\nAt long last I was able to visit Whisky 3 and PS 18.  Instead of the sad, hapless, lacklustre creatures of the conventional army, here were soldiers who had a purposeful robustness and who emanated a dedication of a high standard.  In Whisky 3 I had an hour-long briefing about training methods, operational techniques, combat lessons and current offensive actions by both sides.  I was presented with a bloodstained PL flag and was invited to look at the facilities, which included inspecting a new batch of recruits and a passing-out parade where I was asked to present the prize to the champion shot.  Although it was impossible to know what would happen during \u2018those last few yards\u2019, I had been impressed with it all.\n\t(Many spurious PL flags were made in Udorn, Thailand, and sold to the gullible men of the USAF.  Three years earlier they were selling for US $150 a time.  Those treated with chicken\u2019s blood actually fetched US$ 200 each.)\n\tI was due in PS 18 around 10 o\u2019clock the next day but, when the Beaver landed at Pakse to touch my hat to General Soutchai first, I was given an invitation card from Prince Boun Oum to witness some boat races at Khong Island, General Kouprasith\u2019s home base.  Khong Island is only just north of the Cambodian border and boasts the world\u2019s widest waterfalls.  Soutchai was there already.  I remonstrated as the dress was formal and I was in jungle kit but I was overruled and taken away in an RLAF helicopter.  At Khong I gave the crew a three-hour deadline.\n\tA pavilion had been erected on the waterfront.  The great, brown Mekong flowed majestically by, over a quarter of a mile wide.  My heart sank as I saw a galaxy of brass in serried echelons behind a throne on which sat the vast hulk of the Inspector General of the Kingdom of the Million Elephants and the White Parasol, His Highness Prince Boun Oum and his hardly less large wife.  Two of the million elephants, I thought sourly.\n\tGeneral Bounphone jumped up, came over to me, punched me in the chest and shouted \u2018Commando!\u2019.  I was led to the Prince and Princess and had to sit with them.  She twitted me about not having visited them recently and so gallant was my answer that she went all coy and giggly, reminding me of a hippopotamus with hiccups.\n\tAt last it was time to leave.  I excused myself and roused the crew but the helicopter would not start.  There was a small donkey engine in the machine\u2019s body and Peter Shield, the Beaver pilot, could hardly believe his eyes when a cigarette-smoking crew member tried to start it.  Eventually a large spanner was produced and the starter motor below the pilot\u2019s seat was hit hard thrice and the engine started.\n\tAt Pakse we jumped into the Beaver, flew to PS 18, sited in a remote and roadless area, landing only minutes before sundown.  I was invited to inspect a Guard of Honour that had been waiting there since 10 o\u2019clock.  It was then a quarter to 6.  I felt sick inside and apologised for being so late, the first person ever to do so, apparently.  After a meal I was introduced to and questioned in depth by all officers in camp on many points: the visit to Sam Neua, communist intentions, jungle warfare tactics, my own experiences, were some among many others.\n\tNext morning we had a briefing in front of a large map.  The Major in command let his hair down and told Peter and me of his troubles: besides training men for clandestine operations in MR 4 with an insufficiency of everything, he was also responsible for such tasks as monitoring the Ho Chi Minh Trail.  The latest situation report from one of his teams made gloomy reading; infiltrated six weeks previously, no exfiltration plans had yet been formulated as no chopper pilots would fly that far without unauthorised danger money which he could not pay, having no slush fund.  One of the small group of soldiers committed on that task had died of starvation.  Radio batteries were almost exhausted.  Should they wait for a chopper or surrender?  They were too weak to walk out.  Could they know when to expect an answer?\n\tI asked when the Major hoped to get his men out.  \u2018Yesterday,\u2019 he said, \u2018but I was told there were no choppers after all, despite being told that I could expect one.\u2019  Was that the one reserved for Peter and me, I wondered, hoping desperately that was not the case.\n104***\nOne interesting sidelight on how the RLA and PL managed affairs took place in the northwest of the country, not far from the town of Ban Houei Sai on the Mekong.  One small village, a day\u2019s walk from the town, was divided down the middle, royalists in the south, communists in the north.  There was no friction; they used the same water supply for drinking and washing \u2013 which is what both lots were doing when I visited the place.  The RLA troops had had no pay for six months and the officer in charge spoke about it to his opposite PL number who suggested that he go to Ban Houei Sai and complain to his HQ.  The RLA man objected that he could not leave his post.\n\tA compromise was reached.  All the RLA soldiers would go to Ban Houei Sai and demand their pay.  During that time the PL would occupy the RLA camp.  If successful the PL would accept pay for as many days as the RLA soldiers were away then go back to their own camp.  If however the RLA delegation was unsuccessful the whole lot would join the PL on their return.  Pay was allowed and the PL did move back, five days\u2019 pay the richer.  It was only later that I learnt that the two opposing commanders were cousins.  Chen Shu-lin\u2019s reaction was to laugh and say that he could not understand the inscrutable Lao!\n105***\nToeing the diplomatic line was never easy and, having been asked to address villagers, as sometime happened, I normally managed.  But one day I lost out: I had flown down to Pakse and General Soutchai had lent me a helicopter (\u2018be back before 10 o\u2019clock\u2019) to go to an area of tension, Keng Nyao.  The village had changed hands a number of times since the cease-fire and was on the border of the two zones.  There was a meeting of village headmen from the LPF zone in another village over the boundary river and the local commander, a Colonel, sent a runner to bring them all across.\n\tAt first they were afraid but come they did and I was introduced as the British DA who had recently been to Sam Neua and would tell them everything that the British and LPF officials had spoken about.  It was a tricky situation: say nothing and lose face, say too much and lose my reputation.  So I started with some bland platitudes and gave them a harmless description of the countryside, fish farms, napalm damage and caves, to the growing agitation of the RLA Colonel, a shady-looking man who was half French and half Cambodian.  After several minutes I had had enough and, in any case, I was already late in getting the helicopter back to Pakse.\n\tTo the Colonel\u2019s evident relief I wound up my short address and bade them goodbye.  As I was leaving I heard the Colonel tell the audience that they had probably not understood what I had said as I spoke with a northern accent and what I meant to say was that all communists were bad, that none could be trusted and that it were better that all the headmen were to rally to the Vientiane side\u2026\n\tI crept away, worried how much of that would get back to the LPF and I be branded as two-faced.  I was not my own master to the extent I should have liked but I felt I had avoided the trap of not showing diplomatic impartiality.  In fact I never did get any reaction, negative or positive, so I need not have taken counsel of my fears \u2013 but...\n106***\nIn October every year there was a festival on a flat piece of ground to the north of Vientiane, Thad Luang, and by now the PL were on parade with the RLA contingent.  Later on the King, the Crown Prince and the Red Prince visited foreign stands.  Davidson had briefed me to 'talk Lao loudly'.  (I spoke in nine, including French and English that afternoon.)  I found myself escorting the Red Prince who was haughty, so I spoke Lao loudly to two LPF ministers and their wives in his group.  I made mention of the LPF cultural show of the night before, how I had enjoyed it but that the words of the songs were different from the Sam Neua ones.  At that the Red Prince turned and said, in Lao, how well I spoke Lao.  My riposte was that I feared to talk to him in Lao because he was royalty so had to be spoken to in French (to which he said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, carry on,\u2019) and I said that my reason for talking Lao was to act as a bridge between the two zones as befitted the Co-Chairman\u2019s representative.  He was obviously pleased.  As he smiled his eyes sparkled.  What a game it was!\n\tAfter dark, films were shown outside some countries\u2019 booths.  Scarcely anyone watched the Soviet or Chinese films but many clustered around the American screen, watching with great delight some vintage slapstick.  The PL soldiers were there in profusion, laughing uproariously.  After all, the Marx brothers could be related to Karl, couldn\u2019t they?\n107***\nOne result of my journeying around the countryside was that some RLA officers took advantage of me.  An example of this occurred when I had spent a night at a sub-area HQ at a place called Phone Hong, under a Colonel Somneuk Siharaj, he who later tried to be a matchmaker for me and Princess Golden Fairy.\n\tA month later, he suggested a drive round his area.  We drove down a small feeder road and entered a small Buddhist temple where solemn village elders were waiting us.  I was invited to address them on the merits of Buddhism against the sins of Communism.  I obliged as far as my Lao vocabulary allowed me to.  We left and drove passed a dowdy-looking camp with a board that read \u2018MR 5 Resettlement and Development Unit\u2019.  Being interested in how we resettled our British Army Gurkhas due pension and wanting to compare notes, I asked him if we could call in on the way back.  Grudgingly this was allowed.\n\tIt was pitifully bare of teaching aids, props, furniture and most facilities.  There was no provision for livestock or handyman training.  The Captain in charge gave me a drab and bland briefing that included statistics of square hectares of crops, of numbers of farm beasts and chickens \u2013 but where were they? \u2013 that had a soporific effect on me though I tried not to show it; it was not his fault that the subject matter was boring.  He shot a glance at Somneuk who was lolling in a chair opposite.  Somneuk suddenly straightened himself and turned to the Captain.  In a voice charged with authority he interrupted him in mid-sentence.\n\t\u2018Tell him!\u2019\n\t\u2018T-tell him?\u2019 the Captain faltered, patently distressed.  \u2018Tell him everything?\u2019\n\t\u2018Don\u2019t worry.  I will.  You\u2019ve done well.  Thank you.  This is my decision.\u2019\n\tSomneuk turned to me and continued, \u2018All you have been told so far is completely untrue.\u2019  Thrown off balance I tried not to gawp.  \u2018The \u2018Resettlement and Rehabilitation\u2019 part of this is a cover for our real activities, the training of selected men to go over the line and make contact with the other side, either killing them or persuading them to surrender.\u2019  Infiltration and reconnaissance were also taught.  Not even the Americans (who paid for everything but had little to say beyond \u2018the point of audit departure\u2019) knew the school existed nor did the RLA officially know the school existed, so it had to be run on syphoned funds.  I was told I was the first ever foreigner to be let into the secret.\n\tHe paused for breath and I, riveted in fascination, merely nodded my head, not wanting to break the spell.  How utterly unsuspected and totally divorced from the dull, lethargic briefing.\n\tSomneuk turned to the Captain and said, \u2018You\u2019ve been here a long time.  How many years?\u2019\n\tThe Captain made a swift calculation.  \u2018Ten years, sir.\u2019\n\tAgain my head spun; ten years in one job and under such conditions.  It hardly made sense even in Laotian terms.\n\t\u2018Care to look at our syllabus, our training programme?\u2019 Somneuk asked.  \u2018I\u2019ll give you a copy.\u2019\n\tAnd how!  This was meat and drink to me.  I was told to keep it and that I would be invited back when there was a course running \u2018so that you can really see what we\u2019re doing and talk to the students.\u2019\n\tI fixed up yet another visit, this time definitely going to the school.  I reported in to Somneuk with time to spare and was slightly disconcerted to see the Police Chief and the local District Administrator there.  Our programme was to visit the school, me to address the students, they to question me, a walk around and then finish.\n\tFine, I thought, but why the two civilians?  My mind seethed.  What the hell was this in aid of?  I thought the two officials might just be cadging a lift.  All of us got into my car and drove off towards the school, but passed it. We drove on and came to a large, American-built school that shrieked of \u2018aid\u2019, drove straight in, around the main block and stopped short of an open-sided building, packed full of students.  A line of locals stretched from where the car stopped to the building.  Who, I wondered, was the important person they were all lined up for?  No, it couldn\u2019t be \u2013 but it was.  Me, again.  Misled, made of fool of, properly duped.\n\tTwenty local dignitaries were lined up for introductions and I was ushered onto the stage where a chair awaited me and those who came with me in my car.  The students were waiting for me to address them.  This again was one of those situations that have a dream-like quality of unreality to them but have to be got on with.  After several speeches it was my turn.  I was escorted onto the speaking platform and given a microphone.  I was to be recorded.\n\tI started by winning the audience over to my side.  Just before I stood up I made funny faces behind the speaker\u2019s back as though I hated the idea of speaking, and I made a few more as I introduced myself.  I said I was lucky to be made known to them before they met me outside and called me \u2018long-nosed foreigner\u2019, and I made my nose \u2018squeak\u2019.  I had a resounding cheer at that so, having thought out what I was going to say, manfully started.  I spoke for ten minutes, long enough I thought.  Colonel Somneuk stopped me from leaving and, using the mike, said I had been to Sam Neua and so I would describe it all.  That took another fifteen minutes.  Enough, I thought.  But no \u2013 Somneuk yet again took the mike and said, \u2018Has Communism infiltrated into Britain?  It has in Laos.  Please comment.\u2019\n\tI did my best and, rather lamely I fear, tailed off and made as to sit down.  But no, Somneuk was persistent if nothing else.  His next question was \u2018Britain is a kingdom as is Laos.  How can a country with royalty combat Communism and what is the future of the royalty system in Laos vis-\u00e0-vis Communism?\u2019  That seemed a favourite Laotian theme, made more apt by two narrow UK Labour party victories in 1974, the introduction of the three-day working week in the previous March and Vassall\u2019s defection to the Soviet Union.  I would have had difficulty in answering Somneuk\u2019s question \u2018cold\u2019 in English but I made a stab at it.  As a gesture of defiance I pulled a rude face at the students, wobbled my eyebrows independently and smiled at them vacuously, with a terrible squint.  Clown!  Joker!  Much laughter.  Small comfort but enough for me to make an adaptation of \u2018the price of liberty is eternal vigilance, a few clich\u00e9s about people\u2019s wishes and a final remark that enough was enough was enough\u2026phor di leew.\n\tIn all I spoke for forty minutes and got a big ovation.  All over.  Finished.  But no: the headmaster then got up and made a little speech and asked me to talk about the Co-Chairman\u2019s duties in the present situation in Laos.  So I got up once again and tried my best.  The student leader then came up to the rostrum and asked another question (fielded by Somneuk) and also asked my age, the population of UK and could I stay for four years in Laos?  The students sang me a song and I was shown round, not really taking in much by that time.\n\tI was driven back to the military HQ where I was pressed to stay for lunch, a meal of sticky rice, muddy lake fish and chickens\u2019 legs from the knees down.  During it the tape was played back, my tinny voice jarring me.  To Somneuk\u2019s chagrin I asked to be excused before the tape was finished.  I thanked him for the meal and, trying not to show I was bitterly disappointed, said I presumed that that was not the last time we would be meeting.  He said he hoped not.\n\tWhen the Colonel eventually did take me to the proper place I gave him back the syllabus and suggested \u2018shadowing\u2019 techniques and memory training be added.  (I got details from notes when I was Commandant of the Border Scouts in Borneo, which I sensibly did not take with me.)  The students certainly looked tough and they regarded me with keen interest.  I was invited to address them and was careful in what I said.  We had a discussion and I left feeling that there was the future nucleus of men ready to fight for their King and country.\n\tIt was only long afterwards I remembered that they all had \u2018short back and sides\u2019 so were obviously military men.  Were they really those going behind the enemy\u2019s lines or a group especially brought in for me to meet?\n108***\nThe Director of Intelligence was Brigadier General Tao Ly Lidiluja, an American favourite.  After I had told him about the Sam Neua visit, he asked me about the background of the cold war in Asia between the two communist giants and how Vietnam came into it.  Luckily I had done my homework and from then on a close relationship started.\n\tOne Saturday morning I was invited around to Tao Ly's house and had a long conversation.  He had given me a Top Secret document, an appreciation of the situation as seen from an intelligence angle, issued to ministers and generals.  I congratulated him on it and said how much of it conformed with my ideas.  \u2018It should do,\u2019 was his surprising reply.  \u2018It\u2019s based on what you have told me.\u2019\n\tAt the King\u2019s audience on New Year\u2019s Day 1975, General Tao Ly said \u2018Come to my house next Saturday, at about 5 o\u2019clock in the evening.  Plain clothes.  I\u2019ll warn the guard.  I want to talk to you.\u2019  He seemed unusually serious.  As he turned away he gulped down his half-full glass of champagne and grabbed another from a passing waiter.\n\tI walked to the house and was shown inside.  Tao Ly got up from his chair and, going to the windows, melodramatically drew the curtains.  He called for some coffee for me.  He had a brandy bottle and a glass in front of him.  Even in the gloom it was obvious, from the outset, that he was worried, as well as verging on the broodingly maudlin.\n\tHe started off by telling me that he trusted me implicitly.  We could talk openly, man to man.  I inwardly stiffened, mentally alerting myself for something critical.  His first point was about rumours of spies and agents becoming more active.  He was forming killer squads to infiltrate their gangs once he had tracked them down and he wanted to be ready for his assassins to obliterate them.  Could I provide him with miniature cameras, miniature tape recorders and silenced weapons?  \u2018Second, how can we beat Communism?\u2019  He topped up his glass.\n\tMy mind reeled at the man\u2019s na\u00efvety as he watched me intently, his normally happy face clouded and serious.  I pursed my lips, looked for a long, long second directly into his eyes, and still holding his gaze, let silence hang in the air.\n\tTao Ly knew how absurdly stubborn the Vietnamese were, how easily they could bully their Lao neighbours and how soft many of the RLA General Staff and political leaders had become.  He could read the signs of morale-sapping, fibre-loosening complacency and greed among his brother officers and political contacts.  He was faced with a decision: fight them, join them or escape from them.  He would not opt out there and then as he believed he had a little time left before that option need be taken, hence his invitation to me.  But he was frightened.\n\tHe looked away and broke the slight tension that had started to build up.  As his glass was empty again, he refilled it.  I answered the first question.  As regards the hardware he required in no way could I comply.  I might be the UK \u2018unofficial spy\u2019 but my charter, I repeated, forbade me to help him.  I presumed he had asked me, I continued with a flash of inspiration, because the Americans had already turned him down?  Tao Ly nodded sadly.  It was clever of me to have guessed or did I know already?\n\tI assured him I had no foreknowledge but it was an obvious point.  As regards the second question about beating Communism, my answer would be in two phases, one now and one later.  I drank up my coffee as I marshalled my thoughts.  I thanked him for his confidence in me.  He, too, knew that I, likewise, would respect mine in him.  I spoke more softly than earlier when I had made it known that his outrageous request could not be met, hoping thereby to prevent him from asking me again.\n\t\u2018I have been in Laos over three years and,\u2019 brutally, \u2018I see you as being far too late in asking your questions.  The French had no comprehensive answer nor have the Americans.  Now, almost after the eleventh hour, you ask me.  Had you asked me the question when I first came to Laos I might have given you, just might, a different answer, one that concerned tactics only.  One basic mistake you and your allies have made is trying to find conventional solutions to unconventional problems.  Another was to regard and plan your military responses out of context from political realities and cultural common sense, so you lacked balance and alienated much good will that you should never have lost.  A serious blow.  The North Vietnamese government also made similar mistakes if only because their pendulum swung too far the other way but they rectified theirs quicker than you realised your need to rectify yours.  And by \u201cyours\u201d I include South Vietnam.  I can give you detailed examples later, if you want them.  I tell you frankly you are too late and that now there is no way in which you can win militarily or politically.  Any thoughts you may cherish are doomed to failure and are a waste of time.\u2019\n\tThe stark, chill words hung heavily between us.  Tao Ly\u2019s expression did not change although it was a harsher response than he probably expected.  None of them knew me when I first arrived and \u2018we were prevented from getting to know you quicker by\u2026 until\u2026 much later.\u2019  He hesitated as he tried to skirt round John Lloyd\u2019s left-wing leanings.  He knew they had made mistakes, bad ones, in the past, but why was I so sure in saying, in effect, defeat was inevitable?\n\tI told him I was honoured at his thinking I could be of help at this juncture.  I was sorry if what I had said was outspoken: that was about the past.  I did not think I could be of any assistance in the future.\n\tThere was one last question: did I honestly think that the other side would abide by the Accords and the Protocols?  I weighed the answer.  Yes, I did, but only according to their advantage and the royalists\u2019 total eclipse.  He had one request: \u2018Please, for my sake, try and work out a plan for long-term penetration of the LPF and ultimate success for the royalists.\u2019\n\tTao Ly asked me if I thought the request for assassination kit had any merit.  I told him that I thought he would prove an embarrassing security risk and that nothing of that nature should be given to him, if only because of his drinking habits.\n\tIt transpired that he was being funded to go to Paris and would be contacted there after which a final decision whether any hardware was to be given him or not would be made. \n\tThe problem posed by the Director of Intelligence teased me in a number of ways: it was a subject dear to my heart, it was an intellectual exercise that intrigued me and it was a challenge.  During my long walks over the next few weeks I tried hard to see if there could be an answer rather than what the answer should be.  Eventually I struck on an idea, more of a mind-clearing exercise than anything, and that was to list the strong and weak points of both parties.  That resulted in a paper for my London bosses titled \u2018Pathet Lao v Pathetic Lao\u2019.\n\tThat done it further struck me that all I could really offer was a set of principles based on the right wing taking advantage of their own strong points and the left wing\u2019s shortcomings and, conversely, trying to eradicate both their own shortcomings and their adversaries\u2019 advantages.  It was not, as I had feared, an even balance sheet but one that could, possibly, be used as a basis for future planning.  It would be the kiss of death to put anything in writing, unless it was unattributable; likewise it would be a waste of effort merely to pass it on by word of mouth.  I wrote my answers in Lao and, substituting God and Satan for right and left wing, took my draft to the senior missionary in Vientiane, a Canadian I think he was, a brilliant linguist, a devoted Servant and a friend of mine.\n\t\u2018We\u2019re in for a bad time, Father,\u2019 I explained, once I had convinced the devout man of my sincerity of purpose.  I had wanted to put my thoughts down, in writing, of certain good and bad points that I believed could help the Lao people by having them pointed out so that they could try and enhance the good and eradicate the bad.  I hoped he didn't think that a futile exercise, and I tried to smile engagingly.  We were sitting in the missionary's book-lined study.  He was in the final stages of translating the Old Testament into Lao.  \u2018Not at all, Colonel, but why come to me, delighted though I am to help in any way?\u2019\n\tI told the learned and dedicated scholar that, as he had been in Laos for fifty years, his Lao language ability was second to none and way, way above my meagre efforts, besides which I did not regard my aim as being incompatible with any message that he would want to propagate \u2013 indeed I would welcome it if he could add to my list.  Regarding the final effort I wanted what I wrote to sound like how a Lao would have written it, not a European.  \u2018So much easier for them to follow what I\u2019m driving at.\u2019\n\tSo we toiled away for a couple of hours, the missionary making sure of exactitudes of meaning from a filing cabinet full of notes, vocabulary and proverbs.  I thanked him profusely and returned to my villa.  There I took out some writing paper, ensuring that there was no watermark to compromise the source and, using locally bought carbon paper, switched God and Satan back to the unlovely present, not without a twinge of atavistic conscience.  I only made two copies, both for Director of Intelligence, and took them to my office the next day, locking them up in my office safe, ready for his return from Paris.\n\tI was invited over to Hong Kong to attend the Brigade of Gurkhas\u2019 annual conference.  Before I went Tao Ly returned from Paris and called me to his office.  I asked him how he had enjoyed his first-ever visit there.\n\tHe didn\u2019t like the French any more than he did before he went.  The French who came out to Laos lorded it over them in an overbearingly yet their own standards of behaviour in their homeland were, in many instances, inferior to the Laotians\u2019.  He could see how some people had turned against them, was his succinct comment.\n\tHe asked me for my report on what we had discussed and I told him that I would only see him in his house.  He pressed me to meet him on the next Saturday morning but I said I\u2019d be on my way to Hong Kong and would meet him on my return, on the evening of the following Friday.  He went to a wall safe and, fumbling badly as he inserted the key, took out a document.  \u2018I\u2019ll let you have this in return for what you've done for me.\u2019\n\tAs he gave it to me I noticed his hand trembled.  It was a copy of the report on what he had found out in Paris (the document went only to the King and to the Commander-in-Chief), titled \u2018A Report on the Recruitment of Agents for the Lao Patriotic Front\u2019.  I was now in his debt.\n\tIn Hong Kong it was a marvellous time to renew old contacts, feel free and be back in a world I knew and had known for thirty years.  I managed to get back to my office in Vientiane before closing time on the Friday, as promised.  I rang Tao Ly and was told to come round the next day.  Having made that effort to come back as asked I said I\u2019d be round in a few minutes.  I collected my hand-written notes from my safe.\n\tI walked to the house, making sure I was not being followed.  The General\u2019s sentries did not acknowledge my greetings nearly so warmly as before.  I went inside and saw Tao Ly\u2019s door open.  He was sitting at the head of the table, slumped in his chair.  \u2018Good evening, General,\u2019 I announced, loudly.\n\tHe turned to see who it was.  \u2018Go away,\u2019 he said huskily. \u2018I don\u2019t want you here now.  Come back tomorrow morning.\u2019  I told him that I was not coming back on the morrow and that it was then and there or never.  He staggered to his feet, went and drew the curtains, called for hot, fresh black coffee and told me that he was still suffering from a hangover.  Once we were alone I handed over one copy of the unattributable document, telling him it was what he had asked me to produce.  He looked at it blankly.  What was all that about he demanded crossly.  He had never asked for it.  He screwed his eyes up at it and announced that he didn\u2019t understand it.  Why had I brought it to him?\n\tI told him this was the answer to that second part of his question about how could they beat Communism that I had said I would give him later.  I tried to explain the format of the document, the principles I had thought necessary to base any future action on and the reasons for anonymity.  But Tao Ly was having none of it and put his copy of the table in front of him and, holding his head in his hands, groaned that he was \u2018hung up\u2019.  How could I expect him to read all that nonsense?\n\tSomething snapped in me.  I flung the second copy onto the table and, speaking roughly, told the General that I was leaving both copies with him.  He would study them when he was sober, remember their contents, then burn them \u2013 \u2018tomorrow!\u2019  I would check whether he had destroyed them or not and if he said he hadn\u2019t, I would tell the C-in-C about the Paris report.  Tao Ly looked at me imploringly.\n\tBrashly and angrily I asked him to listen to me.  I told him that I had noticed at various functions recently and in his office that he had been drinking heavily.  It was doing him no good.  He was afraid of being assassinated, he said.  He had had reports that he was on a hit list.  The only way he could combat this was to get drunk.\n\tI had the bit between my teeth by then and told him, \u2018even if you\u2019re not interested, General,\u2019 that I had had a price on my head twice, once in Cochin-China and once in Borneo.  Both times, especially in Borneo, outnumbered and recognised wherever I went, I was razor sharp.  At night even a mouse squeaking woke me up.  The enemy hunted me but could never get me though they tried hard enough.  \u2018But you \u2013 your colleagues will mistrust you, your enemies \u2013 your future partners \u2013 will despise you and you\u2019ve already lost self-confidence and self-respect.\u2019  I had done more than I should have done and, as long as he was like this, I\u2019d do no more.  I bade him goodbye and left.\n\tAs I walked moodily back to my villa I wondered if I had said far too much.  There was no going back even if I had.\n\tA month later at a reception the Australian and Filipino attach\u00e9s came up to me.  Almost in unison they asked me if I had noticed General Tao Ly.  Only drinking squash!  So different from before.  I shook my head.  \u2018That\u2019s twice I\u2019ve noticed it recently,\u2019 said the Australian.  \u2018No, three times,\u2019 corrected the Filipino.\n\t\u2018I hadn\u2019t noticed anything at all myself.  Canberra and Manila will be pleased when you point out how observant you\u2019ve been,\u2019 I said in mock severity which the other two misinterpreted.  They both turned away with a slightly superior expression on each face, as though to show me I was losing out in the historic events that were sweeping that corner of Asia.\n109***\nIt was the practice for every attach\u00e9, once during his tenure, to tell the RLA Staff and Command College students about the organisation of his own army.  I was sent a copy of the programme and saw I was to talk for two hours (far too long even with questions).  The Deputy Minister of Defence, Kaysone Boupha, was due to follow me.  I found some notes on the subject in the drawer of my desk, faithfully culled from the many pre\u00e7is previous DAs had been given when students at the British Army\u2019s Staff College.  I, never having been to that august establishment, did not feel its magisterial burden upon me, nor could I see the Lao being even faintly interested in anything that did not affect them directly.  I decided to broaden my terms of reference.  I asked the Commandant which language he wanted me to talk in, English, French or Lao.  He said, with a grin, it was up to me but please not to speak in Chinese.  In the event I risked speaking Lao (a first I was told).\n\tI began by saying that the students would only be interested to know that the promotion system of the British Army was designed to eliminate all but professional qualifications being considered and that officers were not allowed 'side jobs' to supplement their income.  I then went into details of why and how the British had won in Malaya and gently reminded them it was the only time the communists had lost on terrain of their own choosing.  The audience was fascinated, especially as I traced the development of Chinese guerrilla tactics, the Sino-Soviet quarrel and the Indo-China issue as and how they concerned Laos.  I drew on my own experiences and my talks with the communists, especially the in-depth debriefing I had had with an NVA military adviser to the PL and many PL \u2018ralliers\u2019.  (I did not mention that Communism was about to be beaten in territory of their choosing in the Dhofar province of Oman, 1970-1975.) \n\tAfter an hour I stopped and asked if there were any questions.  There were, searching and penetrating, which I fully answered.  So many were there that I stayed even longer than the prescribed two hours and the Deputy Minister, kept waiting, left in high dudgeon.  I was sincerely thanked and happy that my Lao language ability was up to the task, something my Cantonese would not have been!\n110***\nSome time after the two sides had formed a joint government in Vientiane, the Provisional Government of National Union, PGNU, I flew up to Luang Prabang with two Americans for the Laotian New Year in a Pilatus Porter, the only plane that could land on the pocket-handkerchief apology for a strip at Sala Phou Khoun, a strategically important place where the three main roads in Laos met.  It was held by the RLA.  We stopped off there.  The two American, laden with whisky bottles and girlie magazines, moved up to the Command Post.  Following them I noticed the expertly camouflaged 5.5-inch artillery piece, still as it was the last time I had visited the place.  The Lao officers were sitting glumly around a makeshift table.  The senior American called out to them that he had \u2018brought you some mo-rale boosters\u2019 and all the goodies were put on the table.\n\t\u2018Still not got yer gun fixed?\u2019 asked the other American, knowing that to be the case.  \u2018Too bad, too bad.  Never mind.  This lot\u2019ll keep yer mind occupied for a while.  Brother Gook might make himself impolite any day now so you might consider getting that gun fixed, not that it is anything to do with me.\u2019\n\tThere was not much point in staying for polite conversation after that as the Command Post staff had needed no second bidding to relax and were already clinking glasses and having a first lech at the magazines.  \u2018Never could get them to repair that piece,\u2019 the pilot said, shaking his head as we strapped ourselves in.  \u2018Been like that for two years.  It\u2019s so well camouflaged because they think the PL will be angry if they know it is there.  Can you believe it?\u2019\n\tNo sooner were we airborne when we picked up a message from the forward troops covering the gun position.  The PL had started to attack: supporting fire was needed, supporting fire was being requested but no supporting fire ever came.  I listened on my headset, hearing what the pilot was saying.  He alerted the control tower in Luang Prabang and got the stand-by T-28s airborne.  They were over Sala Phou Khoun not long afterwards and strafed the PL positions.  Nobody knew if it was that which stopped the PL attack or whether the forward troops were plain jittery and there had only been patrol movement.\n111***\nOn 11 April 1975 Sisouk called me to the Defence Ministry.  Outside his door was a PL sentry.  I knocked and went in.  I was beckoned to a sofa and the Minister sat beside me.\n\tHe was in sombre mood, glad that he had the chance to discuss a problem that was exercising him greatly.  He had come to know that there were twenty-seven NVA advisers in the PL camp at Ban Dong Nasok where the Neutralisation troops lived.  They had only recently arrived from Hanoi.  He believed they were high-ranking political cadres, senior party members all.  The advice he needed from me was should he try to have them exterminated or not?\n\tAlthough by then I should have been immune from being astonished at anything I heard, I was momentarily taken aback.  Before I could make any comment Sisouk continued, even more surprisingly, that he would do whatever I advised.  If I advocated extermination it had to be complete, leaving none alive.  \u2018Whatever you advise will have an ineradicable effect on the future of the country.\u2019\n\tEven allowing for exaggeration in the stress of the moment, it was obviously of great importance as Sisouk went on to explain that the country was lost if the twenty-seven remained, of that there was no doubt.  The royalists might still have a chance to make future action easier if those men could be got rid of.\n\tAt that moment the telephone on his desk rang and he went over to answer it.  My mind raced with possible answers: deny his request and miss out on a potential target; accept it and accept the moral obligations of failure and the perks of success; stick to my charter and miss out on a possible lead.  A sudden thought made me reach out for the small table in front of me.  As I felt under the flanges Sisouk put the telephone down and came back to the sofa.  He looked at me.  \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 he asked with genuine curiosity.\n\tI asked him if he had ever had his office debugged.  Sounding peevish, he said he did not understand what I meant and asked me to explain.  I fought back my impatience and told him what I meant.  \u2018I was feeling to see if anybody unknown had installed a bug under this table.\u2019  \u2018But why should anyone want to do this to me?\u2019 came the astonishing reply.  \u2018This is the first time I\u2019ve heard of such a thing.\u2019  His surprise was genuine.\n\tHe was just the sort of person whom \u2018they\u2019 would do it to, I told him in a low voice as I gestured with my head to the sentry outside the door.  The PGNU had insisted that in all ministries every alternating person in rank would be from the opposite side.  The people in the other offices and in the passage did not know everything.  They\u2019d love to find out what he talked about.  There might not be any such device there but we couldn\u2019t be sure and what he had asked me was far too delicate a matter to take any risks with.  I suggested that we ought to talk in the open in a safe place and how about by the plunge pool in his garden?  I had to consider his request.  Today was Friday.  Some time next week I would call and see him.  Would he tell Princess Jasmine that John Cross would ring her up sometime before Tuesday afternoon and would merely ask \u2018when\u2019? and she would tell me what he had decided.  \u2018I\u2019ll be there then.  Do you agree?\u2019\n\tWith a bit of reluctance, yes, he agreed.  I saw he was still inclined to chat so I stayed where I was.  It might be difficult, he said after a pause, as the Prime Minister wanted him to go to a monetary conference in Nairobi towards the end of the week.\n\tUnthinkingly I did something I had never done before during my tour as an attach\u00e9, except to Tao Ly.  I gave the Minister unasked-for advice.  I told him that the morale of his army was so low it was hard to imagine it falling any lower yet if he were to leave the country at that juncture and the PL and the NVA decided to push their forces all the way to the Lao-Thai border, nothing would stop them.  With him in Vientiane there was still a chance.  As I travelled around the countryside visiting units, his name was on everybody\u2019s lips as the only person with any heart left to resist and fight back.  Surely someone else could go to Nairobi?\n\tA dejected Sisouk turned to face me and, with a sigh, said he believed I was right.  He would not go.  Staying in Laos was more important.  Then, with ineffable sadness, he said, \u2018You know even if I stay here it may be too late.  I\u2019ve got such bad generals.\u2019\n\tI had never dreamt that I would be privy to such an admission and felt a surge of pity for this arrogant, ignorant, educated, lonely man.  Without thinking I put my hand out and patted his knee, saying, \u2018You are the Minister of Defence.  What you say, goes, surely?  Give them orders!\u2019  It showed the state of both of us that Sisouk never showed any reaction to having his knee patted and what I had done only dawned on me later when I was rehearsing the interview.  I tried to imagine a Lao DA patting the British Defence Minister\u2019s knee in the latter\u2019s Whitehall office and I blushed at the thought of what I had done.\n\tSisouk glanced at me and scathingly said that I had been in Laos for two-and-a-half years, and I still thought that any general obeyed any of his orders if he didn\u2019t want to?  I had the wit not to answer.  It may have been a glimpse of the obvious to him but I saw I had gone far enough.  I got up, made routine remarks about not wasting the Minister\u2019s valuable time, reminded him of our next meeting and took my leave.  Alice through her looking glass never found such sound and sights as these, surely?\n\tI rung Princess Jasmine and was bidden to be at their house on 18 April at 6 o\u2019clock in the evening.  On the dot I reached it, an old colonial building on the bank of the Mekong, ineffectually guarded against natural and man-made disasters by an earth bund and bored soldiers.  They looked in the car, registered a trace of surprise as they saw a grinning Singha dog looking out of the window and let us drive in.  As I got out, the front door opened and Jasmine, radiant with expectant motherhood, welcomed me.  \u2018He\u2019s round at the back,\u2019 she said smiling.  \u2018Waiting for you.\u2019\n\tI turned the corner of the house and there, sitting bolt upright on a hard wooden chair by the pool, with an empty chair drawn up beside him and a sentry in the bushes to the rear, was the Minister.  I allowed myself a small thrill of satisfaction at what I saw, unthinkable two years before, improbable ever, yet now a fact.  I walked up to Sisouk and was told to sit down.  I was given a fresh lime, citron press\u00e9, an anti-mosquito coil was moved slightly to one side and we started talking \u2013 or rather Sisouk did.  I listened, absorbed.\n\tIt was hard for me to realise what it must have cost Sisouk in terms of pride and prestige to reach the state that now pertained.  Years of wearing a public mask of dubious fit, months of pent-up frustrations and now looming defeat coupled with disillusion with the Americans rose up and spilled out in the garden that starlit evening.  I sat, riveted, concentrating on remembering as much as I could of all that cascaded out during ninety minutes of nonstop, almost unbroken monologue, kept fluent by judicious prompting.\n\tI learnt so much it was impossible to remember it all but the main strands of what he said stayed with me: how, since his heart attack, the Prime Minister, Souvanna Phouma, had been influenced to the point of erosion by his half-brother, the Red Prince, whose real aims had always been the dismantlement of the throne and the creation of a republic instead.  I had always suspected that but our Foreign Office-groomed stalwarts in the embassy would never accept it, especially as only a day or so before the LPF was discussing plans about the King's coronation.  Before his illness Souvanna Phouma would never have countenanced that: \u2018I know it all as I used to help him write his speeches,\u2019 and now he was helpless; how Sisouk had three different intelligence networks \u2013 I knew two of them but the one run by the Provost Marshal, Colonel Loun Sisonol, was news to me \u2013 and which one was responsible for what; how, through various contacts, he had leads into the Politburo in Sam Neua and even farther back to Hanoi; who of his generals were crooked, who inefficient and who stupid \u2013 none was rated higher than mediocre; exactly what the LPF planned to do on the fall of Saigon \u2013 \u2018I promise you I'll let you know when the PL start to move\u2019; likely assassination targets in the Vientiane area; and, because the PL would only advance, initially, as far as Vang Vieng (where they were in 1962 and which marked the old Neutralist boundary) there would be no need for any evacuation plans for the foreign community (the Americans were needed, anyway, as they could be punished more easily by staying) unless, of course, the women and children would feel safer over the river for a couple of nights; who of the foreign community to be careful of and so much more that I felt my head would burst.\n\tAnd then that question which I had been dreading more and more.  \u2018Now what about those twenty-seven North Vietnamese Army advisers?\n\tI had delayed saying 'no' to Sisouk initially just in case I found anyone who wanted to take action against such a target.  Nobody did.  As I sat in the dark garden, it was only in my mind that cocks crew \u2013 not once, nor twice but three times \u2013 as, inadequately, sorrowfully but officially, I heard myself say, \u2018Your Excellency, I regret to inform you that my charter precludes me from acting on your request\u2019 and a silence, broken only by cicadas and stray background noises unnoticed till then, replaced the long lament of oral anguish that, litany-like in its completeness and sincerity, had poured forth for so long.\n\tI, struggling with emotion, not he, broke that silence by lamely saying that I understood His Excellency\u2019s situation.  \u2018Thank you for telling me what you have and, within the limits of my charter and ability, I will do what I can for your country.\u2019  Cross, you pompous bastard, I thought savagely, hating myself, as the Minister slowly got up and said, simply and forlornly, \u2018I was afraid you would say that.\u2019\n\tPrince Sisouk kept his word the very next night.  We were in line receiving guests for the Queen\u2019s Birthday Party and, as he passed me, he leant over and softly said that the PL had started from Sala Phou Khoun at 4 o\u2019clock that afternoon but had not announced it yet.  He had only got the news as he had left for the British party.  \u2018Vang Vieng first stop.\u2019  I thanked him wholeheartedly and sent London a telegram as soon as I could.\n112***\nIn one letter home I wrote:\nIt really is incredible what being a communist means.  Anything that smacks of the Party Line has the same effect on them all: the shutters come down behind their eyes and the light is dimmed.  Hackneyed phrase follows hackneyed phrase: blatant untruths are stuck to with limpet-like tenacity and a direct question is brushed aside or ignored without any embarrassment.\n\t...I went around to the Chinese embassy to fix up a Chinese dinner party.  It was fascinating to watch the shutters lifted when a normal topic was broached.  I was asked by the Chinese if I had read the Cease-Fire agreement and I shocked them when I said no, it was only politics and I was a soldier, not a politician!  I told them the Leftists had, in my opinion, won and the Rightists had lost.  How did I know that and why did I say so?  My reply was that certain of my embassy had met Leftists who were smiling and others had met Rightists who were not smiling.  He who wins smiles, he who loses doesn't.  All the trouble in SE Asia, I was told, was because of the Americans.  I countered this and said no.  I was asked how could I say that and, if not the Americans, then who?  So I said the French were and I was acknowledged correct up to 1954.  It was all rendered less crisp than it might have been as the interpreter wasn't translating accurately all the time.  I know that as a number of little asides between them occurred now and then.  However, I had not gone there to indulge in petty polemics but to invite the blighter to dinner.\n...We went into a list of countries, the representatives of whom would or would not be acceptable to him.  Any country with diplomatic relations was the answer.  How about Russia was my query.  Down went the shutters.  We have diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, you may ask them if you like and we would attend.  But surely there are some you\u2019d like better than others? I asked.  The answer was text-book!  OK, I won\u2019t ask the Russians as it would be difficult and would restrict conversation.  Up went the shutters, \u2018D'accord?'  We then went into the menu: great interest shown at the one I had with me, written in Chinese.  I said I would only ask 8, 12 or 14 guests, not 10 as the Chinese considered 10 unlucky.  What nonsense: we Chinese are not superstitious.  I was then gently upbraided for having, at a previous meeting told their DA that I believed certain Chinese characters had significances.  You don\u2019t read Chinese: you have been told wrongly.  You have been told wrongly about the North Vietnamese Army being in Laos, you have been told wrongly about the Chinese road in Laos, you have been told wrongly that a God exists (recapitulating odds and ends of previous conversations!).  You have been wrongly told\u2026and it all reminded me of my long and circuitous conversations with the [Malayan] aborigines.  I only had an hour and 20 minutes of it \u2026All this is a far, far cry from yesteryear when a man with a red star on his uniform was a scrawny bandit in the Malayan jungle\u2026\n113***\nUp in Long Cheng I went to one battalion and found it consisted of three people, the CO, his wife and a driver.  Everyone else had fled.  How long that state of affairs had pertained I did not know, but I came to the conclusion that the CO had been running a \u2018ghost battalion\u2019 for quite some time, using the American-supplied jeeps as taxis \u2013 until there was only one left, hence the one driver!\n114***\nThe Provost Marshal, Loun Sisonol\u2019s intelligence network was spotted because the facts he was disseminating used a type of paper that was tracked to a source controlled by the Americans, unlike my paper with Tao Ly.  Some time later I discovered he had escaped across the Mekong so I went to see him and the other Lao refugees hiding in Nong Khai.  They were astonished at my visiting them and asked me how I found them.  I told them that I had seen a truck standing outside Loun\u2019s house as the PL were taking away his belongings.  I had read what the bored driver had doodled in the dust on the cab and noticed his incorrect spelling of Nong Khai in the Lao script.  The rest was easy.  None had much luggage and their main problem had been the time it took to get a forged passport.\n115***\nConstitution Day, l975, when both RLA and LPF troops paraded in front of the King.  Most of the Generals were not on parade, having escaped to Thailand during the night.  Later on that unusually hot day was a celebration soccer match, Customs v Police.  I debated whether to attend and I felt I ought.  Dressed in tropical service dress and sweltering, I was driven to the national stadium.  In the VIP stand were the Prime Minister and his son, a UNO man, two American assistant attach\u00e9s, Colonel Tsarkov \u2013 Gulag personified \u2013 the Soviet attach\u00e9 who had taken over from Gretchanine's relief, Vasilli Soloviev and I.  (I got to like Gretchanine.  \u2018I know why you jog every morning.\u2019  \u2018Why?\u2019  \u2018So when you die, you die in good trim.\u2019  He also advised me never to go jogging or walking the same way in succession.)\n\tBefore the game started Tsarkov, sitting below me, turned and beckoned me down.  I accepted.  Calling me \u2018Comrade Colonel\u2019, he said that in our peace-loving socialist countries we had more spirit than the footballers, hadn\u2019t we?  He grinned malevolently.  In a degenerate society like this \u2013 \u2018but not for much longer\u2019 \u2013 what else could one expect?  Quite soon we would see a change when socialist forces were unleashed all over the country, like in his and mine, eh?\u2019\n\tI had seen enough of the Russian elite to believe, as a general rule, that they hated to be ignored.  They never wanted to be loved \u2013 they often seemed to hate themselves too much to know what love meant and so they were content to be tolerated \u2013 but what they respected more than anything else was a person who refused to be bullied or denigrated.  I did not rise to the jibe.\n\tTsarkov made some remark about Britain and the USSR both being peace-loving nations of equal sincerity.  This was too much for me.  I rounded on him, telling him not to make the mistake of muddling my country with his.  In Britain we linked \u2018peace\u2019 to \u2018good will\u2019, in the Soviet Union it was a case of \u2018peace and ill will\u2019.  \u2018Certainly we were allies during the war but since then what have you done?\u2019\n\tScarcely pausing for breath and certainly not waiting for any riposte I read Tsarkov a lesson in post-war history, starting at the Berlin Blockade and working through until I reached current Soviet activities in the Horn of Africa.  I compared the British giving up their old, colonial empire with the Soviet acquisition of a new, European one, including Cuban mercenaries.  Tsarkov, in a lull, tried to steer me away from that topic by talking of \u2018Hitler, the fascist\u2019.\n\t\u2018I hold no truck for him either,\u2019 I growled, once again getting into top gear.  The millions he had killed and the millions Stalin had killed were equally appalling.  But at least Hitler had stood up as a leader and was counted whereas in the Soviet Union\u2019s case personal responsibilities and actions were shielded in a soviet.  And what got me most of all \u2018your odious comparison between our two countries\u2019 was that when in his country a person said \u2018squeak\u2019 shrilly instead of gruffly, a knock came on the door in the small hours the next night and the person was put into a mental asylum and made mad.  \u2018I\u2019d rather be dead than that, so would all true Englishmen.  And I\u2019d take you with me if I got half the chance.\u2019\n\tI relapsed into silence.  Damned tongue of mine, I told myself, but how immensely satisfying to get it off my chest, even if it was all in French.  The final whistle for the end of the game shrilled out and the sweat-covered players dripped off the field.  \u2018But what about Scotland Yard?\u2019 demanded Tsarkov, vainly trying to counter-attack.  I roared with laughter, recovering my good humour and stood up.\n\t\u2018You fool, Colonel Tsarkov!  You absolute fool!  That won't do.  You\u2019ll have to do better than that and we\u2019ve had enough for one day.\u2019  I told him that I wanted him to send me a nice, easily understandable book on his system so even a man like me could understand it.  There must be something in it, I supposed.  The two US officers grinned at me as we left.  They did not hear what Tsarkov and I were talking about but they guessed I had \u2018won on points\u2019.\n\tTsarkov sent me a book with pretty pictures which I gave to my driver hoping they would amuse his many children.\n\tLater Tsarkov so insulted the LPF he was kicked out and sent to Hanoi where I met him.  There I learnt that he could be civil if he so wanted.\n116***\nBy mid-1975 few RLA Generals remained.  One was General Bounphone who sent for me and told me I was the only person he knew who could give him a balanced opinion of how safe he was still working for the PL and whether I thought they would try and assassinate him when they had finished with him.  My advice took the form of analysis of the situation to let him make up his own mind.\n\tBy the time we met again he was the only RLA officer who had not been sent for stringent, even cruel, re-education.  I met him and his wife at a large dinner party given by the Brigadier General in charge of the MMF to say goodbye to Laboucheix.  (The last time I had been at the MMF I was asked to interpret French into five Asian languages, for the ladies, and after ten minutes I was suffering from mental constipation and came to a complete halt.)  At table I sat next to Jubilation who quietly spoke to me in Lao.  He had been waiting to ask me again, should he escape now or wait a month or so?  He had been warned that he would have to go to Hanoi some time in the future.  It was impolite to keep up a conversation in Lao when we all spoke French so we had a two-tier talk.  During the non-French part of it I told him he were better out as soon as possible.  It was to his evident relief; he sighed and said that his wife would not agree.  Would I, after dinner, try and persuade her to go?  \u2018She takes no notice of me but will do of you.\u2019\n\tThe French looked on me as gallant, a loup blanc, \u2013 a \u2018white wolf\u2019 \u2013 and popular, with the story of how, in the middle of a proposal of marriage, I had forgotten the girl\u2019s name and, in my confusion, used her mother\u2019s, tickling their sense of humour.  So when, after dinner I manoeuvred Madame Bounphone, a large lady well past her prime, into a corner, it was accepted with knowing smiles.  We had a long chat.  I knew that she was the business brains of the two and that the casino in Savannakhet was their property so she was understandably unhappy to leave it.  I told her that she would never see any gain from staying where she was and, eventually, she nodded her acceptance.\n\tTwo mornings after that the Chinese DA went round to their house and said that they would be both on an aeroplane, initially bound for Hanoi and thence to Peking, that afternoon.  A notice in the press said that the General had gone for medical treatment.  I never saw them again.\n117***\nBecause I spoke Lao I was the only attach\u00e9 any LPF official would talk to as, for most, speaking English or French seemed to be against all their rules.  I could visit their offices if I had reason enough to.  I nearly came to grief once when I told a mid-ranking man, Thong Damdouane, that the LPF were \u2018jealous of\u2019 the Americans.  I had a twenty-minute outburst as the man worked himself into a fury.  In his wish to convince me that the LPF had their finger on the public pulse he told me how they went into the streets to monitor what people were saying, doing two-hour stints and reporting back to a co-ordinating cell where they collated their material for further use \u2013 and a whole lot more I now forget.  I do remember he was remonstrating with his arms to such a degree that he did not see a woman orderly bringing in two glasses of soft drinks on a tray and knocked both of them out of her hands onto the floor.  Even that did not stop his tirade.\n\tBy then I had learnt their methods which I could never have found about otherwise so felt I needed to cool him down and not jeopardise any future contact.  I did so by telling him I was a fool, thinking that I knew how to speak Lao when I made elementary mistakes.  \u2018I do apologise: I realise I said \u201cjealous of\u201d the Americans when I meant to say \u201cangry with\u201d them.'  I was forgiven, smiles and handshakes, and given an invitation to come back.  It was a ploy I would be wise to use sparingly.\n118***\nDuring my visit to Whisky 3 and PS 18 General Soutchai asked me to give a prize to the best Lao Secret Army shot and lecture both Thai and Lao Secret Army troops.  Several times I met Thai Secret Army men who, under another name, had been my students at the JWS.  Feeling indebted to the General I, oh so foolishly, took him my copy of the JWS course pre\u00e7is.  The PL arrival at his HQ had taken place before I could recover them and, were the PL to discover them, my diplomatic status would be badly jeopardised.\n\tBy then my ambassador had refused all Beaver flights south so my problem was how to recover the wretched pre\u00e7is.  Towards the end of May, 1975, I learnt that a special seminar, lasting for two weeks, was taking place in Chinaimo Camp for the remaining senior RLA officers and that General Soutchai was among those attending.  My problem was how to contact him about the recovery of my set of pre\u00e7is without letting any intermediary know the true reason for my wanting to meet him.  One answer was to drive to Chinaimo and meet the General yet I knew that the camp was fully guarded by zealous PL soldiers.  It would not be easy.\n\tI sat down at my desk and composed a letter.  It simply read: Dear General Soutchai.  I hear you are in Vientiane.  You have given me so much hospitality when I visited your headquarters over the months I want now, in some small measure, to return it.  Can you contact me between now and 7 June and let me know when you can come to my house in Thad Luang?\n\tI signed it and put it in an envelope which I left unsealed, called Khien, whistled up Singha and drove back to my villa to put on some smart uniform.\n\tAt Chinaimo, the dog\u2019s head stuck out of the back window, the PL sentry flagged us down.  \u2018Why do you want to enter the camp?\u2019 he asked in a surly manner, keeping the barrier in the down position.  Khien mumbled something about the Tan Thud [attach\u00e9] in the back of the car needed to go inside the camp.  \u2018I have had no warning about any foreign cars coming here.  Can\u2019t let you in.\u2019\n\tI looked out of the window and said that I knew he was only trying to do his duty but he should recognise the flag on my car and see that I was the British Defence Attach\u00e9. \u2018Now you know my credentials there is no need to tell you more.\u2019\n\tThe sentry scowled back at me but made no effort to lift the barrier to let us through.  I felt anger rising in my gorge.  I fought it back.  I told him I had a letter for General Soutchai who was attending a seminar.  I had no intention of disturbing him but would go to HQ MR 5, contact one of the staff whom I knew and tell him to give the letter to the General.  I showed it to the sentry.  \u2018Would you like to vet it first?\u2019\n\tThe sentry moved slightly forward and ordered the driver to open the boot of the car.  This was against protocol, but I was powerless to prevent it.  He came round to the window and I opened the envelope and showed the letter to him.  I saw from the way he looked at it upside down that he was illiterate but too proud to say so.  With great reluctance, he lifted the barrier and let us in.\n\tI found the Colonel I knew in one of the offices, gave him the letter and asked him to deliver it.  We did not talk much but the look on his face told me all.  I got a telephone call a couple of days later telling me when to expect General Soutchai.\n\tOver a cup of coffee in my villa he told me that my pre\u00e7is were still at his HQ, locked up. \u2018No, I did not bring them up with me.  Maybe I should have done but I have had other things on my mind.\u2019  After some small talk he leaned forward in his chair and thanked me for the understanding way I had conducted my affairs and dealings with him.  Initially he had been inclined not to believe my answers and comments to his questions as they were so different from what the Americans had said.  He particularly remembered one comment I had made, about the Meo General Vang Pao, to the effect that when the Americans left he would be like a man up a ladder with the ladder taken away.  As a result of the collapse in the Sala Phou Khoun area, which Vang Pao should have held, he saw what I had said was absolutely true.  He now trusted my judgement and wished he had taken advantage of it earlier.  It was too late except in one respect: he wanted me to go to Pakse, any time before mid-June.\n\t\u2018Meet me in my office.  I\u2019ll give you a briefing but we may have a PL audience so it won\u2019t be a full and truthful one.  What I want you to do is judge the situation in Vientiane, come and judge it in Pakse, then advise me whether to stay on or leave.  Please, you\u2019re the only man I can trust.\u2019\n\tI found myself saying, yes, of course I would, unless it was physically impossible.  He stayed for ninety minutes and, after he had gone, I told myself never to be so stupid again.\n\tI told Davidson that I thought my presence in Pakse would help get the one remaining English schoolteacher out and he relented, allowing me to go.  At Pakse we saw how much it had changed: no RLAF aircraft, sentries in PL uniforms and anti-aircraft artillery pieces all round the perimeter.  As I turned to go to HQ MR 4, Peter Shield, my pilot, said, \u2018Go and exercise your charm on these PL, Colonel, we might be able to take off more easily.\u2019  Two scowling PL sentries had sidled up to investigate what we were about.\n\tI greeted them with a smile and asked them if they had come to guard us against the imperialists\u2019 attacks?  No answer but a spark of interest showed on their faces.  I told them to stay around and that I was going to see Brigadier General Soutchai.\n\tThe two soldiers, unsure how to react to a Lao-speaking foreigner, watched me as I turned away.  They had been told that any planes would be allowed to land but, if permission for takeoff was not granted, anti-aircraft artillery would shoot it down if it tried to fly away.\n\tInside the HQ building the General happened to be by himself.  He looked tired but brightened up when he saw me.  To my intense relief he gave me back my set of pre\u00e7is, still in their envelope, so rashly given in the best of faith.  I did not dare to ask him if he had ever looked at them.\n\tHe told me about the current situation.  It was not so much that the PL had taken over everything but rather that the NVA had been pouring reinforcements into the area in such strength that a thrust into Thailand as far as Bangkok could be made with no logistical trouble and Kampuchea could be reinforced by NVA troops at the drop of a hat.  All the NVA had been issued with PL-type uniforms and most of their weapons, ammunition, vehicles and fuel were American.  Did I know that?  I said I had heard some rumours to that effect but had no idea in what quantities.\n\tIt grieved him to have to tell me this but so much American equipment had been sold by the officers of his army that the NVA had only to supply instructors to teach the men how to use it.  In fact, all the requirements, less air, for any offensive in that part of Laos could be got from ex-US stock.  How corrupt could one get?  And the currency paid for it all, by the North Vietnamese or their agents, had been the American greenback.  Most of the RLA never had been interested in winning the war \u2013 only in making as much money as possible.\n\tBut I already knew it was not only with arms and ammunition where the black market thrived.  I had already discovered for myself that many administrative and medical needs were lacking at \u2018soldier level\u2019 because entitled stores were never sent to the front line.  \u2018Not available': no, not for the soldiers, that is, but \u2018yes\u2019 for those unentitled people who paid a good price for them and could flog them elsewhere.  When, at one unit I visited \u2018in the sticks\u2019, I was told that the soldiers looked tired because were sleepless.  Oh, Why?  Not because of the PL or the NVA but because of mosquitoes and sand flies.  These latter are tiny little creatures that get into ears and eyes, can drive a person to distraction and infect liver and spleen.  I told the soldiers I had managed, when in Borneo, to combat both types of insects, if only to a certain extent.  We each made a chain of pungent chillies by splitting them lengthways and tying them at the tops with cotton every six or so inches.  Depending on how many chillies could be got hold of and the length of cotton, the \u2018chain\u2019 could be either be worn round the neck, placed on the head as a halo or even tied to poles where a bed net would normally be tied.  Many a good sleep has been had using this method.  The young RLA soldiers were delighted at the idea and a hunt for chillies started there and then.  It worked and the news spread to other units.\n\tI thanked Soutchai for the pre\u00e7is and the information.  I told him it was time he left.  I was sure he was of the same opinion.  A man like him had to leave, if only temporarily \u2013 that was to say for a few years \u2013 until the present madness had burnt itself out.  He nodded, tears in his eyes.  I would fly him out if he wanted me to.\n\tHe thanked me for the offer and said that that would mean we would both be prevented from leaving.  We said goodbye, as friends, and went together to the airport.  He told me to have a word with the sentries; he would go round to the tower.  \u2018Goodbye and good luck.\u2019\n\tThe sentries told me we could not take off otherwise we would be shot down.  I told them not to worry themselves.  This British plane had been to Sam Neua and had permission to travel to Pakse and back to Vientiane.  Comrade Soupraseut [the overall PL commander] had given me his personal word, I lied.  I looked at them closely.  \u2018You two are Rhad\u00e9 men from around Kong My, aren't you?\u2019  I recognised them because they had filed teeth, which I knew was a Rhad\u00e9 custom.  They were and said we could go safely.  That, and what went on in the tower, was enough to ensure an unscathed takeoff.\n\tI never met Soutchai again.\n\tOn our flight back I recalled the very first briefings I had had on my very first tour of all Military Regions.  It had taken me some time to learn one reason why the war had gone on so long and so inconclusively: before one side attacked the other, the defenders would be warned so that they could slip away quietly.  Why should Lao kill Lao?  Even then it had never occurred to me that another reason why the dreary little Laotian war had gone on for so long was due, in great part, to unscrupulous commanders flogging, to their enemies, the arms and ammunition given by their friends, the Americans, to fight them.\n\tHow many of the current higher and middle level officers would live the rest of their lives on riches gained this way?  The thought sickened me but it was the only answer that made sense in the context of what I had been reporting on for so long.  Only at the very end of it all had I stumbled on the truth which I would not have done had it not been for those wretched pre\u00e7is.  Such were the people for whom I had been getting more and more involved.  Why?  I knew my answer, because it was what I was paid for.  Back in London that thought would be seen as neither a cross nor a crown, but an irrelevance.\n\tNevertheless, London sparked.  My Desk Officer. Simon Hutchinson, wrote:\n\tYou have achieved an almost legendary reputation here and even if you were never to send us another line of intelligence it would not be impaired\u2026if anyone can contrive to build something from the ruins you are the man and we all know you will do your level best.\nThe man two up from him wrote:\n\tI thought I should drop you a line to let you know how much all of us here value your frequent reports with their wealth of insight and judgement on people and events.\n\t   As with Vietnam, things have acquired considerable momentum in recent weeks.  Thanks to the fund of knowledge that your previous reporting has built up for us and to your most conscientious and timely current reporting we have been able to cope with all requirements for briefings and assessments without difficulty.  I am extremely grateful to you for this.\n\t\t   I imagine you must be feeling pretty sad at seeing things crumble in this way.  The events themselves were not unexpected, but I for one thought they lay a little further in the future.  However that may be, Laos continues to attract the attention and interest here both politically and militarily.  In this latter connection we would very much appreciate whatever reportage and assessment you can send us, although I know that you could well find increasing difficulties placed in your way, in spite of your careful building up of contacts on both sides.  With every good wish\u2026\n\tIt was nice of them to have bothered to write.\n119***\nAs the LPF spread their influence the Soviets showed their true colours.  On three separate occasions I was told by them \u2018people did not matter; only the leaders did'.  I met General Tao Ly once more and he thanked me for \u2018opening his brain\u2019.  He had recovered his former aplomb and seemed intent on what he could do \u2018from the inside\u2019.  He asked me my views on whether he should escape or stay.  I said that if he felt strongly about his country he would stay.  So he did, along with a number of others.\n\tIt was most likely the wrong advice.  At dawn one morning soon after our conversation, 4 generals, 37 colonels and 103 lieutenant colonels and majors were told to report at a certain place at 5 o\u2019clock that very mornimg, with necessities and eight days\u2019 rations.  About a dozen of the more junior managed to escape over the Mekong.\n\tWhen the officers reported in they were stripped of all their insignia, told to call one another \u2018comrade\u2019 and on the morrow were taken to an area to the north of the Vientiane plain and allotted plots of land that they had to clear with their own hands.  They had to build their own camp, otherwise there was no shelter.  It was then the rainy season.  If they collected materials for making their camp there was insufficient time to collect food to eat, and vice versa.  If they asked any villager for food, it had to be paid for by work.  It was an appalling position to be in.  I can remember how I ended the report I sent to London: \u2018\u2026sans badge, sans brooch, sans braid, sans everything.\u2019\nNo one from the losing side was spared re-education.  The knock on the door in the small hours became a commonplace.  One ex-royalist police captain was called for at 3 o'clock in the morning as his wife lay dying in childbirth.  He requested the authorities to send him another time, so that he could do what he could for his wife and his ten children.  He was told that his country was more important than his family.  He then asked if he could be given until 3 o\u2019clock in the afternoon instead of the 10 o\u2019clock morning deadline.  No.  I had recently read an article in which this caught my eye: the puritanical Marxists who, however Utopian their curious religion may be in theory, invariably increase the amount of human misery\u2026  So it seemed.\n\tOn one of my walks I met the children, still in a state of shock, outside their house.  I tried to comfort them but to no avail.  My dog was better fed than they, despite food shortages, as I had that sack of dog biscuit.  I wondered if I should put the dog down and, having soaked the dog biscuit in water, give it to the children.  I did not but I thought of them each time I saw any advertisement for dog food.\n120***\nAt one dinner party I attended I met the Principal Secretaries to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and of Propaganda and Tourism, the former having orchestrated the anti-American activities.  He asked my views on the situation and did I think they had achieved their political aims?  My answer was a Laotian proverb, a \u2018Yes and No\u2019 type that intrigued them.  I was pressed to expand my answer; indeed I was to be given an invitation to continue the conversation in their HQ.  I never did have an invitation for that but, on learning that I was due away in February 1976, I was asked to stay another couple of years.  I told them that I would be out of the army in five years, at which they asked me to come back and be an English language teacher with them.\n*\nAfter another dinner party the head of Shell, Tim Faithful, was returning late from a party and was stopped by a vigilante.  A bribe was sought because the vigilante said Tim was late.  Tim had no money on him so he was forced to wait until a pipe was procured and enough petrol was syphoned out of the car to fill the vigilante\u2019s own motor bicycle tank.  Shell supplied fuel to both sides in Laos: it was always embarrassing for those flying in the AN-2 \u2013 the largest biplane still operating \u2013 to be refuelled by a \u2018free-world\u2019 set-up.\n121***\nAt the end of June, 1975, two British technicians on loan from the BBC, just about to go home, went flying in the Vientiane Flying Club Cessna aircraft and did not return.  The next morning Peter Shield and I set out in the Beaver, my last-ever flight in it before Peter flew it back to England, and searched the area.  We found the plane at Vang Vieng but my instinct warned me not to go below a thousand feet, let alone to land, so we flew back.  We made enquiries and were told that their paperwork was not in order and that, until Sam Neua gave orders to release them, there they had to stay.  It was thought they were spies.  It was the army\u2019s responsibility to get them out and I was told to write a letter to the MOD, addressed personally to Minister Kaysone Boupha, asking him for help.  The Ambassador wanted me to go by road to Vang Vieng and visit the two men.  I paid the ministry two visits to try and arrange this and the upshot was that I had to go to the Joint Mixed Commission in town for a laisser passer, not for me, as a diplomat I had my own card, but for the driver and the car.  These I eventually got.\n\tDressed in smart uniform, with an overnight bag, I was driven north in my flagged car.  We passed a large notice board with \u2018Liberated Zone\u2019 painted in large letters and, over a small hill, was a PL-manned barrier.  We crawled to a stop, behind a few lorries and a couple of taxis.  When our turn came the sentry stood in front of the car and another armed man came and beckoned the driver to follow him up to an office.  I sat still, waiting.  A third man came and opened the back door.  He saw my overnight bag and searched it thoroughly.  I kept quiet and the man ordered me, in halting French, to follow him.  We went up the slope together and, seeing Khien\u2019s forlorn glance at the laisser passer on a table, I realised that the document I had so sedulously striven to acquire had not worked.  The unexpected comment about it was that, as it had been issued in Vientiane which was not yet in the liberated zone, it had no currency outside it.  I remonstrated and quietly pointed out that one of those who had signed had actually written LPF under his name, but that carried no weight either.  Vientiane was not in the liberated zone; therefore nothing produced there was valid.\n\tI had begun to give up hope of getting any farther that day when I changed my tack.  I congratulated them on their soldierly appearance and said that, despite my having diplomatic immunity, I understood their caution.  I continued by saying that I presumed they realised I was the attach\u00e9 for all Laos, not for one side or the other.  I added that I had been to Sam Neua and met members of the Politburo, which was perfectly true but had no bearing on the actual problem of being allowed through the barrier into the liberated zone.  I told them I had fought against the Japanese in Burma (but forbore to mention what I had been doing since) and, at that they perked up, full of interest.  The Japanese were either \u2018feudalists\u2019 or \u2018reactionaries\u2019 in their lexicon (I forget which) and so I had taken part in the same struggle as they were now participating in.  At that the laisser passer was countersigned and I was allowed to continue my journey \u2013 an hour later.\n\tIt was a strange feeling to have the barrier behind me.  These people had yet another thought process I did not understand.  It was not so much a question of accepting or rejecting normal authority but rather there was a whole range of invisible buttons that had to be pressed before the right combination clicked into gear.  I wondered if it was not something to do with a distortion of oriental face or if they were waiting to see how much homework had been done or humble pie had to be eaten.  It is still an unsolved puzzle.\n\tWhen we stopped in a village for a bite to eat no more notice of us was taken than ever had been the case before the arrival of the new regime.  Some folk talked to us, some ignored us.  Before we left on the next part of our journey a local military commander strolled up and asked to see our documents.  He was a Lao, not being bullied by the Vietnamese, so was his normal polite self and even had a chat before wishing us a safe journey and letting us go on.\n\tI now felt more hopeful of reaching the two Britons but was quite prepared to be foiled.  We reached the junction where the recently-built road from Long Cheng joined Route 13 and in the middle of the highway I saw a rough booth that had not been there before and a crowd of some fifty locals milling round a couple of LPF officials.  One of them turned to us as he heard the car.  He held out his hand in a gesture that meant halt.  I told Khien to stop short of the booth.  I got out and went to see what the hold-up was.\n\tThere was an air of disquiet among the small crowd.  They looked at me as I came up and some of them averted their gaze.  I gave the official the laisser passer to examine and asked if we could drive on.\n\t\u2018No.\u2019\n\tThe man looked at me unsmilingly and turned away.  I went into the booth and showed my other documents to the other man, the elder of the two.  He glanced at them.  Didn\u2019t mean a thing to him, he said.  \u2018None of you can move north from here.  You can\u2019t, they can\u2019t,\u2019 and he indicated the crowd around him.\n\tI explained how I had followed all the rules till then and what my mission was.  How long was he going to keep me waiting?  The man paused before giving me his crushing reply.  As far as he was concerned I would not be going up this road for a long time, ten, twenty or a hundred years, nor would any Westerners.  \u2018I\u2019m not even allowing these people here to go where they think they want to until they learn to take note of our new socialist democratic republic.\u2019\n\tTo me here was a prime example of the world\u2019s most dangerous man, the over-educated idiot whose education outruns his common sense the day he learns how to sign his name.  I wondered if the refusal was due to a rumour about NVA troop movements in the vicinity that were directed against ex-Irregular Meo, now rebels.  There was nothing to do but to return to Vientiane, which I did, giving a lift to a PL soldier caught in a rainstorm on the way back.\nThe two BBC men were released a few days later.  For the first eight days they were treated as spies and the last eight they were used politically.  They were delighted to be out, had lost some weight and ponged a bit as they had no laundering facilities.  They were almost grovellingly apologetic for the bother they had caused.  They confirmed that, had we landed, we would not have been allowed to take off again and had we flown within range of small arms\u2019 fire, we would have been a target.  Not a word of any of this came out in the world press and the LPF let us know, had it, the release of the men would not have been so quick.\n122***\nI used to walk my dog around the area before going to bed.  One night on my way out I noticed a man tinkering with a jeep.  I said nothing to him and, on the way back, he was still there.  I stopped to talk to him, asking what the trouble was.\n\tHe was waiting for his wife who worked as a cook in the house opposite and, to avoid suspicion of loitering, he had to make it seem as though he was having trouble with his motor.  At first he could not place me (he offered American, French, Italian, Russian and Canadian) and when I said what I did he immediately remembered me.  He asked me if I recognised him.  I did not and he told me that he had been Colonel Somneuk\u2019s staff officer up at Phone Hong and had helped organise the occasion when I was \u2018hijacked\u2019 to talk to the students.  At the outbreak of the revolution he had denounced the colonel, the police chief and the local administrative chief \u2013 the three men who had travelled in my car that time \u2013 and had been put in charge of the area.\n\t\u2018So you can travel quite easily?\u2019 I asked.\n\tNo, it was not that.  He had surreptitiously left Phone Hong, come down to Vientiane to take his wife across the river, as he had planned all along.  I asked him why, therefore, had he denounced these three if he had no intention of staying.  His only way to escape was to make them think he was one of them.  He had to do something drastic otherwise he would never have been trusted.\n\tIt was remarkable to have found him and he to talk so freely and truthfully.  I wondered how many others like him there were.  Countless, probably.\n123***\nRevulsion therapy was applied to dissuade venial activities as card playing, visiting brothels (a popular if not national pastime), asking stupid questions at seminars and petty thefts.  A zealous PL patrol came across half a dozen elderly women playing cards; they were taken to a police post and made to play cards from 6 o\u2019clock in the morning, nonstop, until midnight, their faces heavily made up with rouge and lipstick to shame them.  Eating and sleeping were allowed from midnight to 6 o\u2019clock that morning  This went on for seventy-two hours.\n\tFor a man who had answered a question at a seminar incorrectly the punishment was being forced to listen to a tape recording of the question and its correct answer for a similar seventy-two-hour span.  It nearly sent him mad, he said.  However, he was luckier than a person who had just finished a six-month re-education course who unthinkingly said the forbidden Americanism 'OK'.  He had to undergo the whole course again.\n\tAny man caught in a brothel had to wait there until it was established whether he was married or not.  If so, his wife was sent for to take him away; if not, he was forced to marry the whore.  In both cases man and woman were made to walk around the town together for the rest of the day, he with an explanatory label hung around his neck.  One lad of five or six stole an onion and also had to walk around all day with a notice, detailing his crime, round his neck.\n124***\nOn 12 October 1945 the Japanese decreed that Laos was thenceforth to be a sovereign state, with King Sisavangvong as King of all Laos.  The date, 12 October 1975, therefore had a strong attraction to the Lao communists and their whole take-over programme could well have been anchored to it.  It was ironic that Laos, never having been able to attain independence on its own, only managed it by relying on the \u2018Elder Brothers\u2019, as the North Vietnamese were known, to achieve it thirty years later.  Common though that knowledge was, it was taboo to the extent that the whole of the LPF lived their myth with a devotion that meant not only was the Secretary General without clothes but that the whole of the Politburo also went naked.  Skilful propaganda deflected the public\u2019s view from this fact of life, but in any case, as most Lao, as ever, only wanted to be left alone to make love and play their khene violins, the propaganda did not have to be unduly subtle.\n\tCelebrations were to take place in the Thad Luang area, which was increased in size.  Earth-moving plant sent up clouds of red dust as the heavy vehicles took off the topsoil, knocking down shanties, booths and shrubs as they strove to complete the task on time.\n\tThe first event was on the previous afternoon.  A large pictorial exhibition had been put on display in a new wooden building by the side of the grandstand.  Some of the pictures were anti-French but mostly they were of what the Americans had done; bombing was a favourite subject, ruins of Sam Neua and other towns, followed by views of napalm scars, refugees and harassment of US aid officials.\n\tIt was not my business to defend the Americans and much of what they had done was anathema to me but I always took the opportunity to put the record straight in pointing out the good things the Americans had done, the British stood for and the dangers of getting into the grasp of the USSR.  By this time I was positively glad that successive British governments had declined to send armed forces into Indo-China, although that had not always been my view.  Fundamentally I firmly believed that having American allies was better than having Soviet ones.\n\tThe Russians were in festive mood.  Ahead of me was the Soviet Ambassador who laughingly congratulated, in French, a pretty young hostess on the part she was playing in the exhibition.  I could not help it: as I drew near her I asked her, in Lao, if she knew who had spoken to her?  No, she didn\u2019t so I told her, adding that if the Soviets really were friends of the Lao, they would bother to speak the language.  She took my point.\n\tThe LPF representatives were brimful with an \u2018I-told-you-so' look on their faces and the North Vietnamese were as ebullient as I had ever seen them.  It was seldom that I saw happy communists; they nearly always wore grim expressions.  However, among the Asians, I never saw a hard-core communist who was fat.  If nothing else they shared the misery of the people under them.  Since then I have never really believed any man who asserts that his political faith is communism or socialism if he carries too much weight.\n\tAt the exhibition the head West German television man in Southeast Asia, up from Singapore for the celebrations, approached me.  He had been to the Jungle Warfare School in my day to make a film and now he wanted me to take him into the surrounding countryside and, while I was talking to the villagers, his team would record it.\n\tThat evening at a reception in Phone Kheng hard liquor, stolen from the raids on the American commissariat earlier in the year, was offered.  Wives of husbands being re-educated made the small eats.  Wanting to escape to go to another party I tried to slip away but was prevented so I could watch a firework display.  This was the finest I had ever seen, with salvos of bombs that were full of star clusters being fired from Chinese 81-mm mortars.  Chok Di, my house boy, thought the noise was war breaking out again.\n\tUnseasonably, it rained heavily in the night and the red desert was changed into a red quagmire.  Dressed in full ceremonial fig, we were seated in the grandstand by half past 6 next morning.  On the far side of the ground was a tiered stand full of men with coloured squares on poles which, when raised, produced giant \u2018wall posters.  There were policy slogans, a map of Laos and the LPF emblem.  It was cleverly and spectacularly done, all squares being changed in unison.  It must have needed much practice.\n\tA long speech was made, vituperatively anti-American in particular and anti-western in general.  The fraternal community was lauded, as was the USSR.  For the third time in recent weeks they were given credit for winning the Second World War single-handed.  Later the ambassador and I bitterly complained to both Soviets and Lao about the wilful disregard for historical facts and, in both cases, got a rueful grin in return.\n\tInternational media merchants were there in strength.  The march past, all troops dressed in new green uniforms (no badges of rank) and white gloves, was marred by their slithering in the glutinous red mud.  As we were leaving, I went to talk to a group of PL women military police, muddy and tired, standing to one side.  I commiserated with them on their dirty shoes and stockings, saying what a shame it was that all their practice was ruined.  They talked happily until they realised several microphones were being pushed our way.  The television fraternity must have had some film they wanted to finish off.  I wondered how many people, there and viewers, saw the irony of the now-admitted communists talking to a western military man on such friendly terms.\n\tI changed and went for a walk.  It was nastily hot by then.  I spoke to a number of those who had been parading and they were now delighted it was over.  They had been practising for a long time and some of them had to get up at half-past midnight to be in time, others a little later, at 2 o\u2019clock . The PL were worried that there might have been trouble and had billeted one man in every tenth house all over the town.\n\tThe German television team hired a car and picked me and Singha up.  I briefed the driver to tell any local revolutionary committee that the Germans had government permission, which was not true.  I got out of the car on the near side of the village I had chosen and the German team drove through it to the far end.  The idea was that curiosity in what they were doing would have cooled enough for me to be the attraction as I moved towards the cameras.\n\tI did not know that the PL had reinforced the village against any disturbances and as I walked along four of them came towards me so I stopped and had a brief chat.  I asked them if they knew me and, as they did, there was no trouble.  Another uniformed man came hurrying out of a house, saluted me as an old friend and asked, most nervously, who the strangers were.  I told him not to bother as I had cleared it in Vientiane and was responsible for them.  He saluted again and, relieved, went back into the house.  All that was filmed, as was my one-man cabaret act with the children.  Twice, as the crew asked me to wait while they took up another position.  Their efforts won them an award for the best news coverage of the year.\n125***\nAn Assistant American attach\u00e9 based in Thailand came to me and asked how to defeat Communism.  I demurred but, to my surprise, he said \u2018if you don\u2019t know, who does?\u2019\n\tThat spurred me to put on my thinking cap and, after much thought, I produced a list of a number of points that I felt were essential for a successful counter, so preventing Communism prevailing over similar \u2018Free World\u2019 governments:\n\t1\tThe stability of their own political base, coupled with a national faith strong enough to resist Communism;\n\t2\tHaving an over-riding national aim for survival, based on an awareness of Communist tactics, and embracing all aspects of policy, i.e. political, economic, cultural and military as one combined \u2018rope\u2019 rather than utilising individual \u2018strands\u2019 haphazardly.  The corollary to this requirement is to have strong, effective and \u2018clean\u2019 Security Forces;\n\t3\tThe willingness and ability to foretell areas of pressure and to act positively before a negative \u2018knee-jerk\u2019 reaction results in divisive and counter-productive measures;\n\t4\tHaving a strong and reliable intelligence system that can recognise and evaluate the threat;\n\t5\tBalancing the intelligence requirement with a counter-intelligence organisation.  Apart from conventional requirements, prevention of such facets as refugees and unilateral aid donors from setting up subversive infrastructure should never be forgotten;\n\t6\tHaving an effect \u2018white\u2019 propaganda machine;\n\t7\tHaving requisite specialists to train for and counter various areas of subversion, insurgency and terrorism by guerrillas in urban, jungle and mountainous areas.\nI saw that conversion to Communism depended on:\n\t8\tAlready committed Communists using people who have an ability to appease their personal scruples by setting themselves a principle so demanding that they are forced to overcome it; or a purpose that makes every sacrifice worthwhile (and then probably jettisoning both) while\n\t9\tGetting others to abuse their positions in society by rating social contacts higher than their oath of loyalty or normal disciplinary caveats.\n\tWhen I sent it to London I noted that the Soviets, not the Chinese, had the upper hand in Laos but I doubted that would be so a decade later.  I believed that Chinese influence would eventually dominate.\n\tI was to learn that my report was, almost uniquely for a Defence Attach\u00e9, given the status of a Foreign Office despatch that was sent to all embassies.  As there were no sources in it I also took a copy of it round to my Thai counterpart, Colonel Mana Varamit, to see if he was interested.\nHANOI: 1975\n126***\nI saw another communist country when I visited Hanoi as courier.  The Vietnamese authorities in Vientiane had said that there would be no difficulty about a visa but, at the last minute, there was.  It was alleged that I was an American spy.  A hurried signal was sent to John Stewart (through Darwin to Peking then by land line to Hanoi), the Ambassador, who managed to convince the Hanoi authorities that I was a genuine British citizen.\n\tI flew up by Aeroflot full of unsmiling and grey-faced mid-Europeans in baggy clothes.  At Hanoi our passports were taken off us and the functionary at immigration would only give them back if the owners could recite the number.  Most of the passengers could not so were made to wait.  I refused to answer in French and the official seemed so surprised when I spoke in Vietnamese that he gave me mine back at once.\n\tI was there four days and had time to wander around on foot and on a bicycle.  The city is well laid out and I was fascinated to see that there was no bomb damage in the residential area.  All the talk about Hanoi itself being bombed was fabricated, although one bomb did fall in the Indian ambassador\u2019s garden.  The ugly student riots in France were shamelessly orchestrated showing the age-old dangers of the gullible being swayed by the plausible.\n\tSo few vehicles were there that, at each of the many crossroads, they had to stop and hoot a warning of their presence.  Most people used bicycles and, so many and so silent were they, I likened going around the place to being in a room with too many cats and always in danger of treading on one.  There were, in fact, only cats in Hanoi, no dogs being allowed by government edict.\n\tCrocodile lines of school children passed me, the leader giving them the order \u2018eyes right\u2019, with the word of command being the Vietnamese for \u2018Soviet\u2019.  I replied in English but not a blind bit of notice was ever taken.  I was stopped by a sentry and roughly told I could go no farther.  Who was I?  I told him and he demanded to see my passport.  \u2018It\u2019s in the ministry,\u2019 was my answer in Vietnamese as I was turned back.\n\tI stopped and talked to people in the streets.  One and all seemed delighted to be talking to an Englishman.  In the International Club, built by the Soviets (no locals allowed except staff), I made the Vietnamese bar girls laugh.  I talked to Vietnamese when at a cocktail party, the only European to do so.  The Khmer Rouge representative, who had been there many years, surprised me by calling the women men, so poor was his command of Vietnamese grammar.\n\tI went into a small shop.  The proprietor, a man in his fifties, thinking I was an eastern European, asked me in French what I wanted.  I told him who, what and where I was.  The reaction was immediate and impressive.  He told me to sit down at a small table at the back of the shop, the other side of a screen.  I faced the far wall on which hung a large picture behind plate glass that reflected the entrance to the shop.  \u2018Watch that,\u2019 the man said as he sat down with his back to the wall, \u2018and if anyone looks in here for more than five seconds, tell me.\u2019\n\tHe told his wife to bring coffee and to play an old-fashioned wind-up gramophone.  For the next hour, in a mixture of Vietnamese and French, he poured out his heart.  Although the communists had been in power for over a score of years, many similarly aged men (he claimed eighty percent) had never come to terms with them but were too scared to remonstrate or say that life was oppressively difficult under them.  He spoke of territorial friction between the Vietnamese and the Chinese, not only in the context of the Paracel and Spratly Islands but on the common border.  As I did not recognise the border names, I asked him to draw me a map: within fifteen seconds it was drawn, shown me and destroyed.  I found it sad that anybody had to live under the strains that he and his wife, among many others, evidently did.\n\tDespite the communists having been in power since 1954, the Catholic Church was filled by all ages every Sunday (and not there to make a nuisance), but the one Protestant church I came across was used as a library.\n\tJohn Stewart and I went for a walk in one of the public parks and met groups of soldiers.  I talked to them, making them laugh, asking what the signs on their uniforms meant.  They asked us to take their photographs, suitably posed, which John did.\n\tI met the Indian ambassador to Vietnam, Gharekan, late of the ICSC (and a future Assistant Secretary General of the UNO), who was at pains to create a good impression and be pleasant, a nice contrast from his behaviour in Vientiane.  As for Tsarkov, he was more than pleasant.  He claimed that the victory in Indo-China could not have happened without Soviet help \u2013 \u2018our socialist victory\u2019 \u2013 but then he would do.  His table groaned with delicacies, as did those of the Hungarian and Romanian attach\u00e9s.  These both admitted to having been taken in by Vietnamese propaganda about the bombing of Hanoi and were bored stiff.  I was invited to their houses where taped music was played loudly to drown any eavesdropping devices and the freemasonry of soldiers allowed frank discussion.\n\tMy visit to the Chinese DA was of great interest.  Back in Vientiane I had told Chen Shu-lin about my visit and he said I should go and see his counterpart, and that he would write and tell him I was coming.  We had a long and earnest conversation.  The message I was given was to tell the Americans that, despite public pronouncements to the contrary, the Chinese wanted an American presence retained in Thailand lest a greater, Soviet, evil filled the vacuum.  This they did not want to happen.\n\tA remark such as that can only be evaluated as being wholly true, wholly false or somewhere in between if its originator and the person to whom it is given have also been graded for reliability.  I reported the matter and, as is normal practice, never heard any more about it.\n\tIn November I paid a fleeting visit to Burma where I met a one-time foreign minister and several Shan opposition leaders who had been let out of jail within the past few days after many years.  The view of Laos from both neighbouring countries made me realise that there was less in it than met the eye.\nLAOS: 1972-1976\n127***\nOne of my joys was walking with my dog.  On holidays I would walk between twenty and twenty-eight miles, and with my walking to and from the office and mid-day jogs averaged eleven to twelve miles every day I was in Laos.\n\tEvery morning, everywhere, the ritual of political indoctrination would take place.  One Saturday morning, early, miles out \u2018in the sticks\u2019 and still a bit chilly, I saw a group of PL soldiers sitting cross-legged in a circle in a harvested rice field away some way from the nearest village, weapons resting against their knees, being lectured by a hard-faced \u2018cadre\u2019.  They were directly in the line I was taking.  I did not deviate but kept on towards them.  I did not want Singha to disgrace himself so I talked to him, in Nepali, telling him not to chase the goats or the pigs.  He was an obedient dog and stayed to heel.  The young men saw me coming, then heard a strange language from a few paces away.  The cadre stopped talking and stared at me.\n\tI walked into the centre of the group and, still in Nepali, told the dog to sit, give me one paw and then the other.  He obliged me.  I said to the group, \u2018That's discipline.  That's how you won the war.  Without it that\u2019s how you'll lose the peace.\u2019  A pause while I indicated the dog.  \u2018You can call him the \u201clittle soldier\u201d but don\u2019t call me the \u201cbig dog\u201d.\u2019\n\tBlank amazement greeted this eccentricity.  Nothing existed in the book of rules for such behaviour that was not hostile, rude or unseemly.  I wobbled my knees and eyebrows, asking the young soldiers if they could.  They burst out laughing, all semblance of severity gone.  I went up to the cadre, probably a Tai Dam from the Dien Bien Phu area of Vietnam, who looked at me petulantly.  I put my arm round his shoulders, one hand on his head and made a squeaking noise with my mouth.  He gave a start.  Such an occurrence was evidently not yet a common experience.\n\t\u2018You\u2019ve got a mouse in your head,\u2019 I said sympathetically and inanely.  \u2018I hope it doesn\u2019t hurt.  And you still teach politics?\u2019  By then I had gone as far as I dared so, telling the dog to stand up and follow me, turned and left without looking behind.  For a brief moment I felt it mighty cold on the back of my neck.  I often wondered what was said about that trivial, unnecessary and entirely unexpected incident.\n128***\nWhen political cadres announced restricted distances for travel, both by locals and foreigners, in one of the villages I often passed through, the locals asked about me.  The cadre said it applied to everyone.  A braver than most man then asked if this was a people\u2019s revolution or not and was told yes, indeed it was a people\u2019s revolution.  In that case the people here will vote to let the English attach\u00e9 with his dog continue his walks.\n\tThe cadre allowed the vote and when I got to my office early one day I was approached by the senior cleaner who told me the news.  He was already friendly with me as I had had an office staff party in my house, a first I was told, with much happiness and laughter.\n\tI was never stopped by any Pathet Lao, except for a chat.  One day an armed PL sentry got out of the ditch where he was on duty and came up to me.  Having looked left and right he asked me, quietly, which was northeast.  I pointed it out and was told that was the direction he had come from and wanted to go back to.  Then, looking left and right again, even more quietly asked me if I understood all these new words.\n\tWhich words? I queried and out came a long list of political words, such as capitalism, colonialism, communism, democracy finishing up with, as far as I can remember, revisionism and socialism.  Blessing the homework I had done I told him that, no, such words meant nothing to me and we sighed in unison.  He told me that the Elder Brothers made them learn all those difficult words which not of them really understood.\n\tI sympathised and, telling him not to worry, called up my dog and went on my way.\n129***\nMy time was running out.  I had one more duty to perform as acting doyen of the attach\u00e9 corps, as I had by then become.  Some time before, I had asked the new Minister of Defence if all attach\u00e9s could meet him, in a bunch to save him bother.  I was rung up to say that such a meeting was impossible.  Later on in the day I was told that, as it was the army\u2019s twenty-seventh anniversary, it was possible and we were to meet on the morrow.  I was given the time and place; would I arrange for the rest to be there?  Sure.  I contacted them all and, at 5 o\u2019clock that evening, received a message to say that the time and place were altered.  As the Soviet and Chinese embassies did not man their telephones after 5 p.m., that set me a problem that was not easily solved.\n\tThe acting Chinese attach\u00e9, Lin To-nan \u2013 a Lao speaker \u2013 had earlier rung me to ask if I knew how to address a group of senior army officers of the new regime in correct Lao?  Such had not even occurred to me and he dictated the long and complicated mouthful for me, including the new and cumbersome names.  I was most grateful to him.\n\t(When I met him in his office when Chen Shu-lin was away and I forget a French word I\u2019d ask Lin what it was in Lao, he asked the interpreter in Chinese who told me in French which I repeated back in a sentence to the interpreter who translated it into Chinese for Lin who knew what I want to say already.  Risible!)\n\tAt the Ministry (both time and venue had again been changed since the previous evening) I, as senior man, was taken into the presence first.  There were three deputy ministers there and I was supposed to know them all when I only knew one.  I was offered a chair next to the minister and made small talk for two minutes when the next senior attach\u00e9 was ushered in.  At two-minute intervals the others came in, the Russian, Vasilli Soloviev (a second assignment), being late.\n\tChampagne was placed in front of everybody and, nobody knowing what to do, we all stayed quiet.  Was it up to me to propose a toast?  I glanced at one of the LPF whom I knew quite well and he nodded.  Nothing loth, I rose and, turning to the senior man, addressed him as taught by Lin To-nan: \u2018Mr Minister of Defence of the People\u2019s Democratic Republic of Laos and Commander-in-Chief of the Lao People\u2019s Liberation Army,\u2019 then paused for breath.\n\tEmboldened, I went on to say that I was the spokesman for the attach\u00e9 corps who, one by one, I introduced to the Lao.  After that I introduced the Lao to the attach\u00e9s.  I did not know the names of two of them but I covered my ignorance with a neat bit of improvisation.  I went on to say that we were honoured and happy to be allowed to pay our respects on this day, the twenty-seventh Anniversary of the LPLA, and we hoped that the army would be successful in the future in guaranteeing the country from all dangers, and a little bit more.  I then gave an English version, having first ascertained if the new French attach\u00e9 needed a French rendering also.\n\tA toast was drunk and the minister answered, I interpreting.  I broke the ensuing heavy and sustained silence by saying that I hoped my Lao was up to all that the minister had said.  Another silence followed.  Bored to tears, I made an outrageous remark, \u2018I can speak eleven languages but I cannot speak the language of love.  I am still a bachelor but I am not a catamite.\u2019\n\tThat galvanised the minister into saying that my Lao language efforts were appreciated.  He then asked how many people there were in the French embassy who spoke Lao.  I interpreted.  None.  I turned to the Russian and asked him how many Lao speakers were there in his embassy, knowing the answer to be nil.\n\tNone, as there was no Lao language school in Moscow.  I translated this to the minister to the embarrassment of the Russian and the joy of the American.  \u2018I expect the government of the USSR will soon establish such a school,\u2019 observed the minister.  Vasilli stayed quiet.\n\tI went one further.  I called across to the American DA, Colonel Len Wood, and asked him how many Americans had there been in his embassy who spoke Lao.  He could not say how many but quite a number.  When I interpreted that to the minister I added that the Americans learnt to speak Lao because they liked and respected the Lao people.\n\tWhether it was time to go or not, that remark ensured we stayed no longer.  Twenty minutes after we started we were outside.  It had been hard work.  Len said \u2018you were just great\u2019 and what would they do without me?  I replied that such occurrences were few and far between so any opportunity had to be taken.  I had been plugging the Americans\u2019 good points to as many people as I could over the past few months.  The Pentagon sent me a present for my efforts, a box for cigarettes with an army crest on it.  Enormously appreciated!\n130***\nThe old regime was finally swept away and Britain's recognition of the new regime came through on the following Friday afternoon, just in time for the embassy staff to respond to an invitation to the Presidential Palace (the erstwhile royal palace) to meet the new rulers.  There was an air of expectancy: Cubans, all of whom had immediately received decorations from the new regime, winked and sniggered, while the Soviet ambassador threw himself on one Lao and embraced him as though he were his prodigal son.  In contrast the Asian diplomats there behaved normally and with restraint.\n\tAt last I was to meet the Lao communist hard men who had never so revealed themselves either to the western world or in Vientiane since the end of the Second World War.  It was a dramatic moment when they came outside into the spotlights of the many television cameras.  The new President, no longer the Red Prince but now Mr Souvanouvong (who had addressed me as Le Polyglot in his Sam Neua cave) led his Politburo out of the palace with great panache.  They stood, in line, immobile.  The shadows cast were unkind and the \u2018faceless\u2019 ones seemed to be wearing death masks, so gaunt, tired and uninspiring did they look.\n\tThe President read a speech, starting the applause himself at appropriate moments, after which the doyen of the diplomatic corps, the Vietnamese ambassador (no North or South now), read out a p\u00e6an of praise.  The audience, in the dim lights on the lawn, listened intently, each wrapped, no doubt, in private thoughts.\n\tThe presidential party left the steps and wended its way round the line of diplomats.  First the President, then his Prime Minister and the rest of the bunch and, at the very end, looking so fragile and unhappy about it all, came Souvanna Phouma, until then the Prime Minister since I had been in Laos.  I was standing behind the Charg\u00e9 and his wife, and the group took no notice of me.  Souvanna saw me and came through the front rank to shake me by the hand.  I was touched and the thought did flit through my mind that he regarded me, in some strange manner, as a link with the past.\n\tThe Foreign Office sent out a signal asking me to find out how the King and Queen were faring.  Their daughter, Princess Golden Fairy, was worried.  I was told to go to where they were and find out but in no way to let the LPF people think that England had asked for this to happen.  It was a challenge and I succeeded but sadly I forget now how I managed it.  At least I made Golden Fairy happy \u2013 and we did so nearly get married.\n131***\nMy time as an attach\u00e9 came to an end.  I reckoned being an attach\u00e9 was like falling in love: you can only do it properly once.  Travel restrictions during the last few weeks had meant my being office-bound so I taught myself how to type. \n\tThe Ambassador, now Donald Cape, wanted to give me a farewell party, despite my asking them not to.  Most of my old attach\u00e9 contacts had gone and none of my Lao contacts were in town.  He prevailed and I stuck my neck out.  I suggested that he invite the senior men in town to a sit-down dinner.  I think Mr Cape was just a little apprehensive that I was aiming too high, but he gave me my head.\n\tThe Lao guests were the Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister, the Minister of Education (Phoumi Vongvachit), the Secretary of State for War (Kaysone Boupha), the Director of Political Affairs, the senior woman in the Politburo, the wife of the Air Force Commander, the ambassador designate to Britain, the Head of the Protocol Department, and the ex-ADC to the King and now the President's whom I particularly wanted.  I rang the Protocol Department to see if the ADC would accept the invitation.\n\tNobody seemed to be able to contact him, so, with the help of the girl on the embassy telephone exchange, I rang the next man up who, along with the ADC, had come to escort the new ambassador on the morning he presented his credentials.  I asked where So-&-So was.  He who answered had never heard of him.  So I explained who he was and his one up told me to wait while he found out his name!  I was told he worked in another part of Protocol, which we duly rang up, only to be told that they had no idea who we meant.  So I had the invitation card made ready and took it down to the office myself.  On the gate the sentry had no idea who I wanted, and I was directed into an area which transpired to be the girls' wash place.  A PL girl came out, in 'bathroom attire', as I got there \u2013 difficult to say who was the more embarrassed!\nI was passed from one person to another to a third, to a fourth, eventually giving the card to some fellow who seemed to have just that veneer of authority to let me take the chance.  I sent my driver down there the following morning, but he wasn't there, although I'd learnt that that was where his 'office' was.  Luckily I'd given my driver(who had the most terrible trouble remembering the chap's name) another place to try and he managed to run the fellow to earth.  In the event he could not come.  But what a way to go about organising a dinner party remembering that most of the other Lao guests posed similar problems.  It was certainly an eye-opener for Mrs Cape.\n\tThe turn-out for the formal dinner was impressive.  Cape gave a most gracious speech and then he gave a toast.  I took over and made a speech, which Cape had vetted beforehand as it was to be given in Lao.  In the event I strayed from the original and that got the Lao guests laughing.  I proposed a toast.\n\tThe most influential guest, Phoumi Vongvachit made a speech in French.  He thanked Britain for what she had done over the years and said that the LPF was entirely satisfied with what I had done, except for one thing, and that was I had not married one of the many beautiful Lao girls there were.  There would always be a corner of my heart in Laos and that I was always welcome to come back whenever I wanted to.\n\tAfter the meal I told Kaysone Boupha that I was sure that Phoumi had not really meant all that and was rounded on severely.  Of course it was meant.  We were also told that, except for a national day, no such senior group of officials had ever gathered under the roof of any foreigner's house.  The guests stayed until much later than normal.  I went and talked to the ladies with nothing but bonhomie.  In fact nobody could have told that they were all dedicated communists.  A far cry from November 1972!\n*\nWhilst on the subject of diplomacy, I inject an intercalary couple of incidents that happened elsewhere: I am sure that, from time to time, we all say things we regret or am I once more talking out of turn?  Be that as it may, twice a remark I made reverberated decades later \u2013 for which I had no answer but diplomatic silence.\n\tCase 1: I made twelve Nepal Cup football final running-commentary broadcasts in Nepali.  The last, 13th time, was a semi final, Gurkha Engineers versus the Training Depot.  At halftime the Signals Warrant Office in charge of the broadcasting proceedings sheepishly came to me and apologised for forgetting to switch on.  I declined to broadcast the second half.\n\tDuring a trek thirty years later in Nepal I was put up in the village Head Man\u2019s house.  During the course of the evening, I recalled the occasion and was impolite about the person who forgot to switch the set on \u2018that time\u2019.  As I paused for breath, the many listeners shook their heads at such forgetfulness.  The Head Man looked at me and said that he was the one who had not switched the set on.\n\tA collective sigh came from the listeners and I maintained a diplomatic silence.\n\tCase 2: when Defence Attach\u00e9 in Laos the American intelligence agency warned me that the telephone operators in the USA, UK and Australian embassies were \u2018fellow travellers\u2019 under the sway of the communists if not communists themselves so \u2018be careful what you say on the phone\u2019.  Forty odd years later living in Pokhara I was visited by an unknown European man with an Asian woman in tow.  We gave them tea on the lawn.  The man was an Australian.  The woman was not introduced.  The man somehow knew I\u2019d been in Laos and quizzed me at length.  The woman never spoke so I presumed she knew no English.  During my answer I mentioned the telephone women of the USA, British and Australian embassies being leant on by the local communists to report conversations, especially those made by ambassadors and other senior people.\n\t\u2018Are you sure?\u2019 asked the man.\n\t\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\tHe pointed to the woman and said \u2019My wife was a telephone operator in the Australian embassy.\u2019\n\tBoth rose with tea undrawn and, with no goodbyes, left.  I maintained a diplomatic silence.\n*\n We shut the office as I was not being replaced and had to sell everything.  I decided to take the typewriter and typist\u2019s chair back to England as both could not be sold.  And then the European mind showed itself as opaque as the Asian mind so often did.  I had to buy the two items for \u00a30.00, which I did and received an official receipt for \u00a30.00!\n\tI had my dog put down, wept bitterly and left in February 1976 drained emotionally, but delighted to be away.  I had put roots down and pulling roots up always hurts.  If I had not put any down I\u2019d have failed in my job.  I felt desperately tired and emotionally drained.  At the airport the ambassador came to bid me farewell.  My house boy, with his two sons, took me to the plane, he openly weeping.  As the plane took off I saw him wiping his eyes.\n\tThe one overriding impression I still carry of the Lao is that they are one of the nicest people I know and it still grieves me bitterly to see how that godless religion called Communism can so change charming men, women and children to act so spitefully and irrationally.\n\tWhat still amazes me as I write these words forty-eight years later is how I, unconsciously and unwittingly I had managed to touch a chord in so many Laotian hearts, from the children who wanted to go for walks with me to some many of the top \u2018brass\u2019 despite the more than unfortunate situation I found on arrival.  I wonder if never looking down or taking anybody for granted along with a good Lao language vocabulary were the reasons.  But whatever the reasons, the results were heart-warming and made up for seeing the cruel side of Communism in action.\nHONG KONG: 1976\n132***\nI stopped over in Bangkok where I was debriefed in great detail by both the British and Americans before going to Hong Kong en route for a four-month trek in Nepal.  Only after that would I return to Britain.  I had, two years previously, been told that my last army job would be in west Nepal recruiting Gurkha soldiers for the British Army and the Gurkha Contingent of the Singapore Police although the Foreign Office had other ideas for my future, mostly in London, it seemed, where my age would not allow more than an archivist-type job.  I knew, in the heart of my heart, however mundane the job was, provided it was in Asia with Gurkhas, I would welcome it, reminding my potential Foreign Office employer of that Chinese proverb \u2018I\u2019d rather be the head of a chicken than the tail of an elephant\u2019.  So much for my farewell trek of one hundred and seven days five years previously which, apart from meeting old friends was of enormous value for my new job in Nepal which included community relations\u2019 projects, pensions and welfare matters.  I was only once asked how to exfiltrate an absconding Soviet official.\nIn Hong Kong I saw a boy put his arm round a girl while waiting for a ferry and I instinctively looked round to see who was watching him, ready to take him away, but of course no one was.  Had I been under the communists for less than a year?  I saw another youth choose which cassette he wanted to play in his recorder.  I again looked round to see who would stop him from choosing his own tune, but of course no one did.  I had been under the communists for less than one year.  If their system could do that to me in such a short time, what did it do to those who could not escape and to those who knew no better?\nI spent two happy weeks in Hong Kong, meeting many friends, playing basket ball, giving lectures and catching up with the military world I had so missed when an attach\u00e9.  I learnt that my trek was in aid of providing financial aid to forty High Schools in the remoter areas of Nepal, twenty in the east and twenty in the west.  A Gurkha Welfare appeal in Canada had resulted in a sizeable sum of money for education in Nepal and an organisation named CEDAR, Canadian Education, Development and Rehabilitation, was created to administer it.  I was to be their \u2018leg man\u2019 to collect data and to allocate priorities.  A worthwhile challenge indeed and one that would brief me about my recruiting job that was to start in the November.\n\tI was still in Hong Kong when the annual conference of the Brigade of Gurkha, also attended by the British Ambassador in Nepal.  He warned me that the authorities in Nepal were considerably more nervous about such foreign aid than hitherto.  Nepalese education had been completely re-planned in the two previous years and was still \u2018finding its feet\u2019 so I was to expect possible embarrassment and frustrations.  Also, King Mahendra had ordered India Army troops who were on the Nepal-Tibet border, to withdraw, and tensions with India might affect me.  That meant my job of asking financial questions about school requirements might be taken as \u2018interfering\u2019 so my job would not be as easy as it might have been.  Likewise the ambassador warned me that he had been told by the Nepalese Prime Minister that soldiers returning on leave or pension were bringing goods that were so scarce in Nepal that a flourishing black market had developed, somehow robbing India of custom\u2019s currency to such an extent that relations were strained.  If, when I started my job, I did not put matters right, then recruiting from the west of Nepal would be stopped, so robbing the British Army of half of its recruits.  It would be up to me to put it right.  In other words, when my recruiting job started Nepalese authority could be strangely \u2018sticky\u2019 \u2013 but that was nine months away.  Many British officers and Gurkhas told me I was wasting what talents I had by undertaking recruiting as a \u2018sunset\u2019 posting but by that time, with no promotion prospects, a job after my own heart was the obvious answer.  I was to be, in full, the Deputy Recruiting Officer (West), commonly known as the DRO, and Officer Commanding, British Gurkha Centre in Paklihawa (\u2018mad winds\u2019).\n\tWhat did both surprise and gratify me was that nearly every Gurkha I met seemed unusually pleased to see me.  It was remarked on by more than one British officer and, although the probable answer only occurred to me many years later, I think the reasons stemmed from the following: in 1956 I had published a book, English for Gurkha Soldiers, which was cheap (Straits $2.50) and in a format easily understood.  Much later I learnt that liking the book so much two Gurkhas went on premature release, became schoolmasters and used the book to such good effect both were awarded a medal from the King of Nepal; I had learnt how to pronounce Nepali dental and labial consonants properly (I have only met three other non-Indian foreigners who could) that when I gave the running commentary on the inter-unit Nepal Cup football final over the radio, twelve times in all, I was taken for a Nepali; articles I wrote for the Gurkha newspaper, some of which so amused them that at least one man fell off his chair laughing; talks on the radio with similar, if less drastic results; and my general approach to them.\n\tIn the first thirty years service I had spent ten of them in the jungle, in Burma, Malaya and Borneo with Gurkhas.  By then I knew them better than I did my own countrymen and probably better than any other British officer did.  Later I thought that the word \u2018homosexual\u2019 had two meaning.  One, homo (from Latin \u2018man\u2019), sounding like \u2018dove\u2019 meaning \u2018dived\u2019 to me meant homo sapiens mated with homo sapiens: the other, homo (from the Greek meaning the same), sounding like \u2018dove\u2019, the bird, meant \u2018boy and boy\u2019 or \u2018girl and girl\u2019.  I mentally divided this latter into three; homo-social, homo-erotic and homo-sexual.  I put myself in the first category: by the time I was about to be the recruiter in Nepal I had learnt how to live with the Nepalis, especially the Gurkhas, in most of, if not all, his moods.  All those factors led to a reciprocal morphic resonance that, to me anyway, explained why the Gurkhas regarded me as they did \u2013 but it took many years so to think out why they did.  Subconsciously I knew that the type of Nepali the British enlists as soldiers is utterly opposed to categories two and three of my list.\n\tI remembered what my wise Nepali instructor had told me in early 1945 that there was a fundamental difference between a military Gurkha and an \u2018in-country\u2019 Nepali so I knew I still had a lot more to learn when I reached Nepal, which I did on the 29th of February, 1976.  But I had yet to learn that the hill people had a proverb, \u2018the King does not ask stones anything: the stones do not talk to the King.\u2019\n*\nAn example of how my empathy with the Nepali made me a target of vituperation was when there was a thirty-six-hour curfew in 1990 I was the only person to escape because I knew how to talk to the soldiers and police on duty, so was allowed to be picked up by a British embassy vehicle.  The airport had been put out of bounds for four days and when buses took the tourists away the left-wing press, knowing that I had escaped, printed that they were four lorries taking the corpses of unarmed civilians shot by the Royal Nepal Army for mass burial.  The article accused \u2018Colonel J P Cross of having taught the army how to kill such people.\nNEPAL: 1976\n133***\nWhen I arrived in Nepal to start my four-month CEDAR trek the weather was perfect, crystal clear views of the Himalayas, warm by day and cold enough for a good sleep at night.  In Kathmandu I \u2018touched my hat\u2019 where protocol demanded before flying on to the eastern Depot of the HQ of British Gurkhas, Nepal,  at Dharan and also my eastern counterpart.  I was given my \u2018trek permit\u2019, without which movement to a district not on it was forbidden and which had to be shown at every police post passed.  I fixed up my trekking kit and met my soldier companion-cum-escort.  I hardly ever walked by myself in Nepal.\n\tBefore starting off I went to the local educational authority in the government office to check the list of schools I had been given.  I am glad I did as I found many discrepancies, one of which saved me a six-day walk.  We went by vehicle to the road head and set off on foot.  As I walked from school to school my mind often turned back to Laos and compared it to the Nepal I was passing through; both are landlocked countries with China to the north and a friend of the USSR to a flank, Vietnam for Laos and India for Nepal.\n\tMy Nepali teacher in early 1945, a brilliant linguist named Lieutenant Colonel G G Rogers, who was the son of the first CO of 2/1 GR, raised in 1885, had said that Gurkhas inside their own country were different from those enlisted.  Indeed, when I had become DRO the Police Superintendent in charge of the Western Police Training Centre near Paklihawa Camp, Indukumar Barel, whose elder brother, 2301 Battalion Quartermaster Havildar Babarsing Thapa, was in my Indian Army unit, 1/1 GR, and an army footballer, told me never to treat the Aryan Nepalis, Brahman and Chhetris, as though they were the type of Hillman we enlisted.  The great majority of government officials, school teachers and senior army officers are Aryan Nepalis.\n\tI found many agricultural Chinese posters in many schools and houses I passed, bland and effectively friendly, and I wondered whether China would \u2018win\u2019 in the war to make Nepal a communist state or would the Soviet Union by pressure through India.  And how would Nepalese peasants react to what the Laotian peasants had to?  No land ownership, men marched out to their task after a political lecture at dawn, meals cooked communally and brought out by the womenfolk.  Marched back under guard in the late afternoon, allowed home to wash and relax before another communal meal and political lecture.  I couldn\u2019t see such happening but when there is no \u2018individuality\u2019 allowed and pressure from the autocratic top becomes lethal if not adhered to, the wisdom of the oppressed is to bend and survive rather than not to bend and break.  In my Thai language studies I found that story in a children\u2019s book so clearly the way to survive was well known, with the indigenous rulers less paternalistic than had been the British in India and her colonies.\n\tI came across some Indian teachers who were studying for their degree and came for six months\u2019 teaching practice \u2013 and that was an ideal opportunity to spread words the Indian government wanted spreading at that level.\n\tThere were no roads so I walked everywhere.  I compared the attitude of the headmasters, police offices and administrators that I met with their Lao equivalents.  As I did I looked back with amazement, and not a little satisfaction, at the way so many senior Lao military men had put their trust in me and not the French or the Americans or so they had told me.  For the former, colonial arrogance had offended me from the very start in 1945 and so I could understand the Laotians waiting for their day of independence, probably never realising that their new bosses would be worse than the French; and for the Americans I think it was a combination of their occasional brashness, at times intemperate language to senior people and sometimes showing intolerance: I was frankly shocked to hear one ambassador \u2018effing and blinding\u2019 to the Deputy Commander-in-Chief, to the latter\u2019s total embarrassment, which undid so much goodwill financial and military aid had achieved.  For me, I was used to living with Asians after twenty-eight years with Gurkhas, speaking Lao well enough to hold reasonably fluent conversations, not being a brothel or party man and, in the background, Britain was well known by the educated segment of society for having handed back to indigenous people government of their own lands after being their colonial masters at Britain\u2019s own volition not having been forced to by defeat at Dien Bien Phu in the octave of Easter, 1954.  \u2018Winking these thoughts into my tiddle cup\u2019 I journeyed from school to school, learning the while.  Nepal had been an xenophobic closed country for so long that it was all of thirty-eight years later, when I had become a Nepali citizen, that doors were opened as they had been in Laos.  But of course then I had no thoughts of anything so far ahead.\n\tI admired the teachers, some of whom walked for an hour each way twice a day.  The schools I visited had pupils from the type of people the British Army enlisted.  Some of the vocabulary used in teaching was strange to me and I wondered how, if at all, the younger students understood what was being taught.\n\tIn some primary schools I glanced at conditions were such that three classes sat on three benches and were taught out loud by three different teachers.  The cacophony was intense as the children echoed the teachers and I wondered how much was actually learnt.\n\tOn my journey I saw the same unease as in Laos before the King was forced to abdicate when people looked left and right before answering anything I said and only answering in soft tones that no one could overhear.  What did this presage, I wondered, and when?\n\tEvery school I saw was impoverished as far as fabric was concerned and furniture was mostly communal benches and tables, not desks.  I had no trouble but only kindness from the teaching staff and much interest from the pupils.  I found that the educational authorities banned elementary chemistry sets which would have been bought in India.  In all it was a hard-working, successful but tiring escapade.  I walked seven hundred and twenty-five miles in forty-five walking days, so averaging seventeen and three-quarter miles a day.  It became hot and our paths led up and down steep hills but it was wonderful to be walking again without fear of any military opposition.  Even so I was glad when I finished.  My trek had let me unwind, giving me much exercise, meeting old friends, peaceful surroundings and a totally new task to interest me.  I had seen some of the same mistakes that the Royal Lao Government had made and my heart wept within me.\n\tI gave back my trekking stores, thanked my soldier companion, wrote up and gave in my full list of recommendations for all forty schools \u2013 and went back to enjoy four months\u2019 leave with my mother.\nLONDON:1976\n134***\nI got home, mentally whacked, and learnt that a coup had taken place in Thailand.  I read in the paper that the new prime minister, an army general, had said that he had a five-point plan to beat the communists.  They were five of the six points in the paper I had prepared for the counter to communist revolutionary warfare before giving him a copy.  So Mana Varamit had forwarded his copy to Bangkok, or was it coincidence?\n\tI was debriefed by senior officials and was disappointed that they were unwilling to extrapolate my experience in Laos from the \u2018Indo-China case book\u2019 to the \u2018Northwest European case book\u2019, as it must be almost unique to have watched a communist takeover from the grandstand, so to speak, been accepted by and kept faith with both sides.  \u2018But we have read your reports with great interest.\u2019\n\tI spoke to a senior official in the Foreign Office, whose answer was that his office and the Ministry of Defence could only advise government, not dictate policy.  \u2018You had better write a book to get it off your chest.\u2019\n\tI tried my hand at A Stranger Truth which, although turned down for publication, was therapeutic for my battered soul.  In 2023, as part of a series of nine historical novels, it was included in a contract to be made into a television series.\n\tI was rung up by Princess Golden Fairy and we met and discussed marriage.  We both decided it was better not \u2018to stir the blood and blur the stud\u2019.  Instead I got engaged to Sally and she said she would come out and marry me.\n\tBefore I left my mother told me we were invited to lunch with someone whose son had known me in the Jungle Warfare School.  Before we got there our host went to the local pub for his pint and those sitting round the bar asked him if he had heard the news?\n\t\u2018What news?\u2019 he asked.\n\t\u2018John Cross is dead.\u2019\n\\\t\u2018I hope not,\u2019 he said, \u2018he\u2019s coming to lunch with us.\u2019\n\tThat, as well as being demoted and claimed as dead by Indonesia\u2019s Radio Pontianak and being similarly published in the Sarawak Gazette made it three times \u2013 which, when the Gurkhas heard about it, made all of them say I\u2019d live to at least a hunded and five years.\nNEPAL: 1976-ONWARDS\n135***\nI arrived in Nepal, suitably refreshed and mustard keen for a job with soldiers once more.  One of the facts of my posting to Nepal meant that I was now serving in a Hindu kingdom having already served in a Buddhist one, Laos, a Muslim one, Malaya and a Christian one, the Land of my Birth and that of the godless religion of Communism, namely Laos after the King had been forced to abdicate.  Not only were those differences to make life interesting, Nepal had never been a colony, albeit the British then Indian governments certainly had an effect on certain Nepalese government decisions.  And not only that, Nepal had been a closed country for centuries and all Europeans were suspect.  What I did not realise until the end of my time as the recruiter for western recruits was that I had been taken as a spy from the very start.  No previous DRO had either been as fluent in Nepali, both speaking and writing, or as knowledgeable about the country so that just had to be another reason.  Try hard as some did to find it, none did \u2013 obviously, as there was none.  That did not affect serving and ex- soldiers but it caused \u2018ripples\u2019 of doubt among the majority of Aryan Nepalis.\n\tHappily unaware of such untrue rumours I was delighted to return to soldiering with soldiers after being a diplomat.  The Lao word for \u2018diplomacy\u2019 carries no subtle meaning but the Nepali word translates as \u2018the policy of deception\u2019.  It is worth recording that besides the King of Nepal the two DROs were the only people who, by recruiting a Hillman, could get him out of the country where he could prove himself on merit, unlike being unable to in his own county.  This was one result of the pernicious caste system: our soldiers came from the third rank down of four that stem from Manusmriti (the \u2018r\u2019 is a trilled \u2018ri\u2019) is a more than two thousand year old legal document.  It dictates that those people who live in the foothills of the Himalayas, people who have crossed from the northern side, are equal to untouchables whose touch does not pollute water.  The result is a subcutaneous \u2018cold war\u2019 between the upper two of the Hindu castes and the lower two.  Those the army almost entirely recruits are from the third level and so life in an army unit is, as a rule, free from caste tensions.  They are the people who thought there should be a king on the throne.\n\tThis subcutaneous \u2018cold war\u2019 developed between the two groups, who met at a rip-tide that ran along the centre of Nepal.  Those tribes who had crossed over the Himalayas and originally settled below the snowline came from an area where the time for sowing crops was short and time horizons were limited more to the here-and-now than otherwise.  Those higher caste people, the Brahmans, came from the plains of the hotter south where lives were not forced into such a narrow compass, where people had to stay nearer to their homes and not emigrate so as to be near family gods.  Those from trans-Himal, not being Hindus, had no religious reasons for staying near their homes.  They did, and still do, feel infinitely superior to all others.\n\tThis was vividly shown when a referendum was to take place to decide whether the current non-party system should prevail or whether a multi-party system should be imposed.  Much propaganda, for both systems, ensued, chiefly with the upper castes violently in favour, the others not nearly so, if at all.  Upper caste antipathy showed itself in a degrading fashion: an ex-soldier, living in the mountains, climbed a tree to collect some fruit.  He did not immediately notice a bear following him.  He turned round when he realised that the bear was also after the fruit, jumped down, hitting the bear hard on its nose as he did, the nose being a bear\u2019s most tender spot.  As the man slid down the tree the bear\u2019s paw took out a large chunk of flesh from his left thigh.  The man landed on the narrow path then fell forward down a cliff, only being restrained by a tree.  He could not move but he managed to staunch the blood but could not reach the lip of the cliff so had to stay where he was.\n\tA search party from his village only found him at dusk on the morrow.  Food and blankets were later lowered to him and he was only able to be rescued the next morning.  He was carried, most painfully, to the nearest hospital for treatment.  The upper class doctor asked him whether he would vote \u2018multi-party\u2019 or \u2018non-party\u2019.  On hearing that, the doctor refused to treat him.  The wretched man was put on a bus and brought the hundred jolting miles to my camp, where it took some four months for him to be fit enough to go back home.\n\tAnother example was when a retired Gurkha officer broke his leg falling off a horse he too was asked the same question with the same result.  His soldier son was on leave and I arranged motor transport for him to take his father to the British hospital at Dharan.\n\tBut the doctors were not always able to control events.  Two scions of the royal family wanted to be shown around the new hospital in Pokhara.  They sent for the senior doctor who was engaged in a major operation.  So powerful was the royal family that the doctor left his patient and before going to see the royal couple went to the ward where my second-in-command lay ill to tell him why he\u2019d be late in coming to see him, and then took the royal couple round the hospital.  After they left he went back and continued the operation.  I think the patient didn\u2019t live much longer.\n\tThe King was also a \u2018snooper\u2019.  I know of one case when, disguised, he went to an egg distributing office and looked at the books.  He found a large discrepancy.  The man in charge was taking more than half the eggs and, pretending they were his own, sold them, keeping the money.  He did not last long.  In another case, still disguised, he went to a doctor\u2019s house after hours and asked for medicine for a headache.  He was told by the doctor\u2019s servant to go away and get a ticket at the hospital on the morrow and be seen then.  The King then claimed his headache was too bad to wait and the doctor sent down an aspirin tablet.\n\tThe next day, the doctor, one of the best in the country, was posted to one of the more remote health posts in the country.\n*\nThe British Gurkha Centre, the recruiting camp for western Gurkha recruits, was \u2018at the end of the line\u2019 as far as every facility was concerned.  Its name was Paklihawa, the local dialect for \u2018mad winds\u2019 and at certain times of the year, the lu wind made the body ache, and it was athwart the Indian border.  Luckily there were some large shade trees which made the place about five degrees cooler than the surrounding countryside, a blessing in the hot weather.\n\tI shocked, I think is the correct word, many inside the camp and outside, for the first time in the twenty years the camp had been established, either by jogging outside along the road or playing basketball every day.  I shocked them more when Sally arrived.  She saw that life with me as an army husband would be too hard for her and I said I\u2019d leave the army but I had to finish my tour first.  She decided to leave: it was most fortuitous as the poor girl died of cancer three years later.  I shudder to think how I\u2019d have managed single-handed with a young child.\n\tMy future worried me.  I thought I could live in England with my spinster sister, Gillian, who then lived in USA and was the only foreigner to have her race horse training colours.  She took part in the Preakness Stakes, the women-only event, more than once.  On one trek I somehow felt \u2018heavy\u2019 and did not respond to people who talked to me.  On arrival back in camp a telegram awaited me to tell me that Gillian had been killed in a motor accident near Baltimore.  I felt alone in the world.\n136***\nOn the very day I arrived in the camp, cramped by no exercise for a few days, I went for a run and met the lad, Buddhiman Gurung, who became my surrogate son.  That was in October 1976 and what I only learnt in 2024 was that only the day before he had sat beside the river that flowed past the camp, deep in thought at the futility of life with no prospect of any job nor anything to look forward to.  He had nearly decided to end it all when he stopped short and went back to his quarter.  How I came to learn about it was that he had gone to Kathmandu in April 2024 and, on an empty side street he was accosted by a total stranger who asked him if he was Buddhiman Gurung. \u2018Yes.\u2019  \u2018I am your fan and a sadhu\u2019 who also had won a gold medal.  The sadhu told Buddhiman how he had sat beside the river in deep and unhappy thought and decided not to jump into the river.  Buddhiman assented the truth of what the sadhu had said.  \u2018And from then on your life improved didn\u2019t it?\u2019  Yes it had and it was the very next day that, on my first ever run, I saw someone walking towards me, stopped him and spoke to him.  It was Buddhiman, half an inch too short to be enlisted so not in that part of the camp where enlistment was actually taking place.  Now as I write this nearly fifty years later, he is Nepal\u2019s best known singer and dancer of traditional western Nepalese songs and dances, with all-expenses-paid trips to Hong Kong, and later to Vietnam \u2013 no smiles \u2013 Thailand and Cambodia, and USA, with two daughters medical doctors, one daughter mastered in \u2018humanities, the elder son in the British Army\u2019s The Queen\u2019s Gurkha Engineers and the younger following his father\u2019s footsteps here in Nepal.  Had it not been for Buddhiman my life would never have been as happy and fulfilling, difficult though it has been at times and but for me  his future would have been vastly different \u2013 but how had that sadhu known when the two of them met in Kathmandu that day?  I am still overwhelmed at the way such people know \u2018about it and about\u2019.\n*\nMy arrival as the new recruiting officer was certainly known about and on my very first day my one-time driver when I was commanding the Gurkha Para Company ten years earlier, burst into my room with his son whom he had taken out of school in Dehra Dun, so he said, to hand over to me.  \u2018He is yours, to polish your boots, to send to the Singapore Police or do any job you choose to give him,\u2019 he told me.\n\tThat was just the sort of occurrence I did not want: to be thought of being job-giver to anyone who turned up would send a message that I was a \u2018soft touch\u2019 and life would be burdensome and not my own.  I remonstrated but no, the boy was mine to do anything I wanted him to do.  I could do anything I wanted to him.  The boy meanwhile looked on, bewildered.\n\tI saw my chance: \u2018anything?\u2019I queried.  Yes, anything at all I wanted to do with him was the unequivocal answer.  \u2018In that case I give him back to you\u2019 and that, as is said, was that.  However, people tried to get me to enlist their sons \u2013 \u2018Saheb, we played football on the same side twenty years ago\u2019 was one reason given \u2013 and, as late as 2020, men traipsed over from far away for me to help get their sons enlisted.\n137***\nI only had my first recruiting to do a year after I arrived.  Normal requirements were for about two hundred recruits a year.  I had forty men in the hills to start matters off and to select the few numbers I needed from an average of two thousand aspirants every time.  I \u2018played God\u2019 to 80,000 people and had to discard 79,800.  If ten people benefitted from one man\u2019s enlistment I prevented 798,000 people from any financial enhancement.  It was a heavy burden for me to carry.\n\tSadly there were cases of some unscrupulous men taking advantage of a young hopeful\u2019s ignorance of who were those I had made responsible for recruiting work who found themselves robbed of ill-spared money.  In most cases I managed to track the few miscreants down and put a stop to such practices but there must have been times when I never knew who was behaving badly: the lust for money excites pocket, palm and purse almost everywhere.\n\tOne unexpected difficulty was experienced; the news that the camp was soon to close and move to the geographical centre of the country, Pokhara, about a hundred miles to the north, caused much unhappiness for the veterans who had built a house near the camp for ease of pensions, welfare and medical care.  They caused me and my staff so much worry that the national press suggested I was preventing Nepalis from having their constitutional rights.  The Soviet attach\u00e9 asked his British counterpart if the J P Cross referred to was the one who had been in Laos.  It was eventually sorted out in my favour.\n138***\nTime is flexible in Nepal.  The only time, especially then, that was unmoveable was cosmic time, the start of certain religious ceremonies, and dates of marriage for example.  For all the rest a \u2018come-what-may\u2019 approach was normal.  Within a week I had to go to a welfare centre down in the south of the country to sort out a nonsense and while there, as I wrote home, thinking my mother would be amused: the man I had called for to interview at 10 o\u2019clock was late so I was asked to go and visit the senior local government functionary, the CDO.  He was immersed in a furious quarrel and told us to come back at 1 o\u2019clock.  To fill in the time I felt I ought to visit a health post in the vicinity that had had British money, so we drove over to it.  The people already warned to be there were absent so we sat down in the sun as there were only four walls and no roof, having run out of money to build anything else.  Eventually the men came and I heard the estimated cost and wondered if my funds for such work would run to such an amount.  Tea and biscuits were brought out for us.  I decided it was time to leave to go to the CDO but was waylaid to visit a primary school that had also received British aid.  It took twenty minutes to drive there.  I reckoned on staying only a few minutes there.  But the children pupils had to be called out of class and given six marigold garlands to put round my neck.  I was sat down in a chair in the headmaster\u2019s office and told to write in the visitors\u2019 book before being taken round the classes.  \u2018But it\u2019s time to go.\u2019  But no, more tea, biscuits and pineapple slices were brought along, after a long wait.  I said we really must be going but someone brought a camera so we were had to have our photos taken and that took more time than it should have.  \u2018We must be going,\u2019 I said once more but, no, all the children had to be called out of class again, put into two rows, \u2018right dressed\u2019 and we had to say our goodbyes and then we did get away, not too late for the CDO, who was the least worried at our delay.  He paid more attention to others in his office, to letters he had to sign and to look at various documents, interrupting me in mid-flow.  I stopped talking and, quite some time later, he told me to come back on the morrow when he was less busy.  On the morrow I looked in, saw he was as busy with over twenty people in his office and decided to return to my camp.\n\tOne CDO, to whom I suggest I could help him, using my Community Relations budget, with a deaf and dumb school.  He considered that for a while and said, \u2018no, let\u2019s have a change, a blind and dumb school.\u2019  He got nothing.\n\tAnother CDO gave me some sound advice: \u2018Never trust what is said.  Only trust what is written when it is endorsed with a government stamp of approval.\n\tIt was not long after that I started to go blind.\n139***\nDespite being so far off the \u2018beaten track\u2019 I got two letters, one from Thailand and one from Laos, the former from a Lao lad I had financially helped who was now a refugee and wanted money.  He had sent his letter to the \u2018English embassy\u2019 in Nepal and, despite taking four months, it reached me.  I did send some money to him, and to the other letter writer, my one-time servant Chok Di, who still wanted to be my valet and needed money.  I hope he got what I sent him.\n\tI also got a friendly letter from the West German ambassador, thanking me for all the information I could pass on to him when he visited Laos.  I am glad he did not mention the time I was trawled to be southeast Asian \u2018leg man\u2019 of the international hand-gun firm, Heckler and Koch, which I had already refused.\n\tAnother, and more unexpected, link with the past occurred when I was asked to attend the opening of a new flour mill.  The Chief Guest was the Pakistani ambassador.  I saw he carried a regimental cane and after the ceremony I went up to him and, after introducing myself, asked him about it.  It was the cane of the Guides Cavalry which was the only badge the Pakistani Army had not changed, less the changing the motto from the Roman script to Urdu.  We then found out that he had been the subaltern armoured car escort to my one-time 1/1st Gurkha Rifles when we left the Northwest Frontier in November 1947, the last Hindu battalion so to do after Partition on 15th August.\n140***\nThe man I had as a batman had to be changed because he was too deaf.  He had been a shepherd before he joined the army and one day he had put his head down and gone to sleep on the ground.  A leech had entered his ear and sucked too much blood for the good of his hearing before it found its way out again.  In due course the lad came to the camp as a potential recruit and when he showed his ears to the British doctor who was checking his hearing cleverly presented his good ear twice so was recruited as all his other attributes were what was wanted.\n\tFour months into his recruit training he was discharged as unfit.  I took pity on him when he came for his final documentation and took him on as a batman.  However good he might have been for routine work in the camp I found him unsuitable for trekking purposes.  I got rid of him and gave him a job in the soldiers\u2019 cookhouse so needed someone else to help me out.\n\tThe first day ever that I was in the camp I saw a young man who seemed to have every attribute to be an excellent soldier but being half an inch too short was ineligible.  He had come from his village as there simply was not enough food to feed his widowed mother and her other three children.  The senior Gurkha officer in the camp, the Gurkha Major, GM, gave him a job in the cookhouse that looked after the Warrant Officers and Sergeants.  This had happened before I took over and when I found out I remonstrated: we were not a rest camp for hungry youths.  But I relented when I learnt he\u2019d starve otherwise so I allowed it.\n\tDue to the change of our location to Pokhara, a hundred miles to the north, as well as a reduction in strength, the mess when this lad, Buddhiman Gurung, worked came to an end.  I asked the GM if he was suitable to work for me.  \u2018Yes, he is.\u2019\n\tHe came to see me in my small bungalow when I was having a midday cup of tea and an apple.  I knew his background of poverty so asked him if he would work for me.  I then said I would not give him a wage but give him enough money to buy land that could support a family once he had married so he would not know poverty and hunger again.  I added that I would clothe him, feed him and give him enough pocket money for his needs.  Yes, that suited him, he was happy at that.\n\t\u2018What shall we call each other?\u2019 I asked him, not sure of the correct protocol.\n\tHe looked at me as though I had asked him a stupid question.  \u2018Father and son,\u2019 was his answer.  (And, forty-eight years after that as I write this, we have been surrogate father and son ever since and, I add with utter sincerity, if he had not helped me with the trials and tribulations of going blind when the doctor wittingly did not call me forward for an operation for nine months, I doubt I\u2019d have kept my sanity.)\n141***\nLike the leech in the sleeping man\u2019s ear, there was another case of a leech going up a boy\u2019s nose when, cupping his hand to drink water, a leech found its way there.  The lad felt it uncomfortable and started losing weight before the cause was discovered.  The remedy was for the boy not to drink any liquid for twenty-four hours and a then a saucer of water to be place under his nose.  As expected the leech emerged towards the liquid but was so slippery it could not be caught.\n\tAnother day and night without liquid and the next day a cotton noose was placed between the boy\u2019s nostrils and the leech.  As it showed itself emerging it was allowed to feel no danger and the noose was drawn tight \u2013 and effective.  The danger had been that half of the cut leech would go back up the nose but that was averted.\n\tA doctor from a battalion visited us and told us another such story: this time it was a boy of about six years of age who was deaf and dumb.  No one seemed to know why as, in his very young days, he had seemed as normal as any young child.  Came the time his father got permission to take his family with him back to his unit.  There the doctor found out about the mute boy and minutely examined both ears and found in each one sprouting soya bean seed.  The boy had been playing with them about three years back and had put one seed in each ear and they had stayed there, sprouted and grown.  Very carefully all traces were taken out, the boy learnt how to talk and caught up with his education.\n142***\nNepal was a closed country for many centuries and our military presence was, if not resented, then to be kept within limits.  In my camp we had a fire extinguisher that, with a long hose, could be pulled where it was needed.\n\tOn one side of our camp was a village where many of our civilian staff lived.  One day a fire broke out and the villagers, knowing about our extinguisher, rushed to the camp to get help.  The duty fire piquet was quickly assembled and, with a British officer, rushed into the village to put the fire out.  They were amazed and bitter when a member of the Nepalese police turned them back: why?  Because they were all in the uniform of a foreign army they had no right to be on Nepalese soil anywhere outside the camp.\n\tNo argument prevailed and, dejected, they returned to camp while the villagers eventually managed to quell the fire with buckets of water.\n143***\nWhen, in early 1945, I learnt how to speak Nepali my instructor was an elderly lieutenant colonel, a brilliant linguist and a first-class instructor.  He warned us that the Nepalis in Nepal were not like our soldiers.  That remark was reinforced by Indukumar, the Police Superintendent in charge of the Western Police Training Centre who had invited the GM and me to a sports programmed when, after all the events of the day were over, we were invited onto the flat roof of his accommodation and, \u2018because you are new in Nepal I must tell you\u2019 he gave me the same message, as well as to drop in at any time.\n\tI had already seen differences but being warned did me no harm, even so I had a nasty case to try and settle when the son of a retired Gurkha officer who worked in the camp stabbed a small boy.  I knew that the stabber was a bad character but hand him over to the police and punishment would be go to jail and father\u2019s name as well as the camp\u2019s would also suffer.  To keep him in camp would mean all the families in the camp would fear for their own children\u2019s safety.  So what to do in this country where only personal contacts and money can solve problems?\n\tSo remembering the invitation to \u2018drop in at any time\u2019 and had also, with my Community Relations money, had a lavatory built for tourists near the police station on the Nepal-India border, near to the camp.  I arranged that the lavatory be officially handed over to the police so invited Indukumar to attend as the police representative.  We arranged the time and the GM went to the police station in our transport.\n\tThe business over I went straight back to camp while the GM loitered and asked for a lift back to camp in Indukumar\u2019s transport.  By the time they reached the camp I had got the Gurkha officer and his son into the GM\u2019s office where Indukumar gave the father and the son such a warning the boy was reduced to shivering tears.  The father\u2019s name and the camp\u2019s reputation were both spared public disgrace and the boy was suitably chastised.\n144***\nMy GM had done such a splendid job with the very many difficulties that I recommended him for an award, which went to the very top and he was made MBE, a Member of the Order of the British Empire.  I asked the British Ambassador, His Excellency John Denson, if he would come to the camp on the Queen\u2019s Birthday and present it.  I also asked the highest Nepalese official, appointed by the King, the Zonal Commissioner, who was the equivalent of the British \u2018Lord Lieutenant\u2019.\n\tJohn Denson was a Chinese and a Greek interpreter and when in China had become friendly with Mao Tse-tung\u2019s wife and the \u2018Gang of Four\u2019.  A great many Nepalese civilians were invited and, all of us wearing our ceremonial uniform, the event started by the two senior officials standing under the flags of their country and toasting the ruler of the other\u2019s country.  The GM was called forward, the citation read out and the Ambassador was handed a cushion on which the award and pinned it on.  It was followed by a communal meal.  It was a solemn occasion, a \u2018first\u2019 in every respect.\n\tBut for Buddhiman it was a disaster.  He had published my gold-plated \u2018gong\u2019 so hard all the gold had come off, so making the medal silver and a grade lower than it should have been.  When he was told about it he was sure I\u2019d get rid of him and he would have to find a new life.  I told Buddhiman \u2018it happened\u2019 and not to worry, we would get the medal re-coated with gold in India.\n\t\u2018I knew then that we were father and son the way you treated me and I was overjoyed\u2019 he told me long afterwards.\n145***\nI was invited to the 1978 Chinese National Day in Kathmandu as their DA had known Chen Shu-lin and Lin To-nan from my time in Laos.  I could not use my Cantonese unfortunately but it was an enjoyable evening.  But it was sobering to think that both communist attach\u00e9s in Laos were keeping tabs on me.  If so, to what purpose, and how many other one-time attach\u00e9s evoked a similar follow-up?\n146***\nI met an old friend, a Gurkha Major, who told me that his son and a friend had climbed high in the Himalayas to the south of Mount Everest and when they were well about the snow-line they had seen two grotesque creatures, bigger than humans and dressed in rags.  The two lads had watched the two, what? Yetis? for about six hours before being spotted.  Rags and bones were seen around the area.  The creatures chased them, gesticulating that, if caught, they\u2019d eat them.\n\tI listened, fascinated, and didn\u2019t know what to say when boy\u2019s father asked me if he should believe his son or not.\n*\nMaking mention of Everest reminds me that the Surveyor General of India, Sir George Everest, 1780-1866, wouud get annoyed if his name was pronounced as \u2018Everest\u2019, not as  he preferred it \u2018Eve Rest\u2019,  However, with the height of the mountain, ever, everer everest sounds sensible.  Just suppose the Surveyor General\u2019s name had been Bloggins \u2013 not nearly so good-sounding!\n147***\nI was sitting down on a chair under a tree outside my room having my hair cut.  Up in the branches was a crow that pissed and the liquid entered the barber\u2019s ear as he leant forward with his head cocked to one side.  Great gloom ensued, not so much at being pissed on but by the unlucky omens that would face him.\n148***\nAll this time I was getting blinder and blinder.  I continued with my trekking, visiting places I felt I needed my presence, to meet local officials, recruiters or Welfare Centres.  There were no roads so I had to walk.  Black and white shadows on the ground were particularly difficult to navigate.  Buddhiman walked behind me with an umbrella handle near my pack straps to try and catch hold of me when I fell.  He was not always successful.  I managed to procure a white umbrella which gave me some relief.  When we camped near a river he would lead me into the water and wash me.  After my evening meal he would help me find a place to squat.  I was utterly dependent on him.\n\tOne day as I sat in my chair I told him that I could not be cured and rather than be a permanent nuisance, unable to do anything on my own, it was better I jump off a bridge into the river and drown.  His reaction was immediate.  He fell to his knees, told me I was his that \u2018what I eat you will eat\u2019 and that he would always look after me.  I was weepingly touched and utterly relieved when doctors came to look at the potential recruits\u2019 health to let me know I could be cured.  It made me grasp how long and insidious the loss of sight had made me and I gently let my mother, whom I had kept ignorant so as not to upset her, know.\n\tBuddhiman\u2019s wedding was due and, as his father, I was a key figure.  Unfortunately just before I was to go up to his village the Chinese Foreign Minister visited Pokhara and many sympathisers went to meet him.  On their way back they attacked our camp, shouting obscenities but not doing much damage.\n\tThe world press got its fangs into the story and I was ordered to investigate what Nepalese officialdom\u2019s reaction was.  The ambassador wanted my answer in four days, next Saturday, so meaning I could not go to my son\u2019s wedding.  We were both most disappointed.\n\tI had been called to the military hospital in Hong Kong to have my eyes operated on but, sadly, I had quarrelled with the senior doctor in Nepal because the doctors from Hong Kong to look at our recruits had done some sight-seeing in Kathmandu and arrived two days after the were due, so wrecking my \u2018jigsaw-puzzle\u2019 tight programme.  He got his revenge by not letting me know that the hospital had called me forward for nine months.  Of course, I was ignorant of that fact until eventually I did arrive at the hospital, where, much to my surprise, they gave me a piece of their mind at my dilatoriness.\n149***\nOn the 10th of December 1980 the Prince of Wales, on an official visit to Nepal, came to the British Gurkha camp in Pokhara in his role of Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Gurkha Rifles.  It was after he had been on a trek when, so it later emerged, he had made up his mind to ask for Diana Spencer\u2019s hand in marriage.\n\tJohn Denson, the British Ambassador, came the day before and spent the night with us.  I had had plenty of warning of the visit as, apart from anything else, some blood of the Prince\u2019s group had to be ready in case...  I had put in a large dose of belladonna eye drops to let me see better but the sun was strong and I kept my peaked hat as low as I could to avoid discomfort.\n\tBefore the royal entourage, which included a Nepalese Prince, came I told all the hundreds of veterans attending that I was virtually blind and so could not introduce them so they had to introduce themselves.\n\tExactly on time the motorcade swept in.  \u2018Which car is the Prince in?\u2019 I asked Denson.  \u2018The one with the flag, you fool,\u2019 he spat back at me.  Not seeing at all clearly I asked him which one that was.  \u2018The one in front.  Go and open the door and I\u2019ll open the door of the second car that has the Nepalese Prince in it.\u2019\n\tI saw the front car stop and went over to it.  My hand was on the door handle when I realised it was the driver\u2019s door I was about to open.  I quickly changed direction and let the Great Man out.  After signing the visitors\u2019 book I took him around the assembled crowd waiting to meet him, five with Britain\u2019s highest decoration, the Victoria Cross, some having done royal duty so already knowing the Prince but most of them \u2018ornery\u2019 veterans.\n\tBuddhiman\u2019s new wife watched from the upper storey of the officers\u2019 mess while he himself was in the crowd.  The Prince shook his hand \u2013 \u2018oh how soft it is\u2019 he told me later\u2013 as I guided him around.  \u2018Have I got to meet all those men?\u2019 he asked me, with a quiver in his voice, having had a quick glance around him.\n\t\u2018Sir, it may mean nothing to you but it making each man\u2019s year, not their day.\u2019\n\tMy GM sidled up to me and whispered \u2018You\u2019re going too fast.\u2019\n\tI slowed the pace and some time later the GM sidled up to me again.  \u2018You\u2019re going too slowly,\u2019 he muttered so I quickened the pace.\n\tThe Prince stopped in front of one man and put out his hand to be shaken.  No reaction.  \u2018What is your regiment?\u2019 he asked.  I translated it and got the answer that the man had never joined the army.  In fact he did not know how to shake hands and had slipped through our security cordon.\n\tThe Prince was interested.  \u2018Why are you here?\u2019\n\t\u2018To meet you.  We have all heard you are coming to the camp.  I\u2019ve come to meet you.  Five days\u2019 down, one day here, five days\u2019 back so eleven days\u2019 farming missed.\u2019\n\tThe Prince was slightly shaken by the gruff response but visibly moved.\n\tA female reporter took a photo and it was published as \u2018The Prince of Wales shaking the hand of a Victoria Cross winner.\u2019\n\tThanks to my GM, we finished exactly on time.  The Prince asked me what I would do when I went on pension and I said I had no idea.  He queried me again and I gave the same answer.  \u2018Then I\u2019ll find you a job\u2019 he said as we parted.\n\tWhen I tried to find out what it was, the Prince\u2019s \u2018side-kick\u2019 refused to pass my query on as he had not heard what the Prince had said to me.\n150***\nAfter I was extended in post I was sent to England for a month and sat the Final Diploma of the Institute of Linguists, in Nepali, which otherwise I would taken when on pension, pass mark 90 percent.  I was graded outstanding on my oral but failed one paper that was written in Sanskritised Nepali I was not used to.  I was given an extra twenty minutes by the invigilator because of my poor sight.  The standard is higher than that of a first-class interpretership and rates equal to a BA with honours.\n\tI set up two world records: the first person ever to sit the exam in Nepali and the first person to fail it.  My eyes were not ready to be operated on so back I went to Nepal, gropingly.  Four hours after finishing my final recruiting my eyes became useless.  Luckily it had been arranged for me to go to go for treatment the next day.  We drove to Kathmandu and I was helped onto the plane.  I had to change planes at Bangkok and wait several hours.  My luggage was mislaid and an hour later it was found.  I was called to the customs people to open it.  I badly fumbled with my keys trying to find the lock so raising suspicions.  My Thai language came to my rescue and all was forgiven with smiles.\n\tThe plane to Hong Kong was late.  On arrival I got into a taxi and, in Cantonese, told the driver to take me to the \u2018military hospital\u2019, I knowing the special word used.  He didn\u2019t know it and we wasted much time until I explained what I meant.  It only later occurred to me that the driver probably spoke English.\n\tI had to wait five weeks between the eyes being cut open, the clouded lens removed and the eye stitched up.  Five days after the first operation I was handed the exam paper for the one paper I had previously failed.  I had been given a \u2018rough\u2019 pair of spectacles, unsuitable for reading.  Luckily I had a small magnifying glass which I put, upside down, under the specs resting on the top of my cheek bone, and managed to cover the left eye, which did not like the light I had to use.  If I leant forwards too far the magnifying glass fell forward and out: if I lifted my head it fell straight down.  I balanced my head, gave myself an unauthorised extra twenty minutes and only just finished on time.  I wrote a covering letter explaining that I had not had time to read through my paper because...\n\tThe first operation had been \u2018copy book\u2019 but the second was nearly a disaster.  But sight was, blessedly, restored and thereafter everything was either fresh and beautiful or tattered and tawdry.  When I first went on a walk with my tunnel-vision specs on I noticed people walking by themselves looked past other people with a bubble of solitude in their eyes.  People talking together had an invisible vibration between them.\n\tSome weeks after I got back to Pokhara, where I was lovingly welcomed back most of all by son Buddhiman; I got an envelope with the crest of the Institute of Linguists on the back of it.  I knew I was about to set up another, a third, world record but would it be the first person to pass the exam in Nepali or the first person to fail it twice?    It was the former.\n\t.  After eight months I returned to Hong Kong to have the stitches taken out of both eyes, then went back to finish off my time as DRO.\n151***\nIn the nearly five and a half years in the job I wore a pedometer when I went on trek and walked over a thousand miles a year, even though for the past twelve months I was escorted by Buddhiman.  I managed to do more than any predecessor had been able to do, knowledge of the language and \u2018pulse-throb\u2019 of the civil community immeasurably helping.  I had many plaudits from high and humble, had my share of difficult problems to deal with and now it was time to go.\n\tI had put my name forward for four jobs, some as a \u2018retired officer\u2019 and others as a civilian in England.  I found favour with none of those to whom I had applied.  I knew I had to go home and live with my widowed mother, meet friends and try to be a civilian.  Meanwhile farewell party followed farewell party.  I gave a reply to my Gurkha officers\u2019 eulogy be saying that if I didn\u2019t make them laugh I\u2019d cry.  At the end I was garlanded, told to stand in a bedecked vehicle to meet soldiers and civilians standing at the edge of the camp road before alighting at the Quarter Guard and inspecting the men drawn up to pay their last military respects,  That done I saluted the flag, my relief saluted me and I left the camp in the same vehicle.\nJust outside was another one, waiting for me with Buddhiman and my luggage in it.  We drove away, stopping in one village to bid farewell to two of my Para Company men now retired, spent a quiet night at a Welfare Centre and reached the Transit Camp in Kathmandu on the morrow.  There I was handed a letter from the university professors\u2019 quarters signed by an unknown Nepali.  I was invited to an evening meal that day.\nBuddhiman and I went to the given address.  The quarter was full of men, women and children and, as the letter writer never introduced himself, I started what I did in Borneo and Laos, made the children laugh.  Everybody joined in and I was the centre of attention (I nearly wrote \u2018attraction\u2019).  We had a delicious meal and when it was time to go one of the professors told me that Nepal had a need for people like me and that I should meet the Vice-Chancellor.  I quailed at that but at 1 o\u2019clock the next day, Sunday, a working day in Nepal, 18 April 1982, meet him I did in his office.\nI found he was the same man who had been the Zonal Commissioner two years previously with an office not far from my camp.  We were not strangers.  He told me he wanted me on his staff.   I said I\u2019d work for free but he said no, I would be paid.  \u2018Come back any time you want to come after your leave in England.\u2019\nI was momentarily stunned then excitedly accepted.  It meant I had a civilian job in Nepal and so there was no need to search for one in England nor come out and visit my son and his wife once a year as a tourist.  We would be family together.  Superb!  Stupendous!  Supreme!\n\u2018I\u2019m going to the palace soon.  I\u2019ll tell them about my offer.\u2019  That meant I would work in the university with the King\u2019s knowledge and blessing.\nI thanked him.  We shook hands and I left his office.  By the look on my face when I joined Buddhiman waiting for me outside he knew I had good news.  And it was even better that he had ever imagined when I told him about it.\nI went back to England to spend time with mother, have a long rest and then, in due course go back to Nepal and start a new life.\n152***\nOn my return half a year later it was the annual holiday time and the university, as well as all government offices and schools, were closed for a month.  I was met by Buddhiman and taken to his village where my arrival was awaited.  I had no idea why until we reached the place and I found out that I had to place a new idol in a temple.  The area was packed and, although I had no idea just what was expected of me, I took it as a great honour.  I was told by the pundit and stood so near the sacrificed goat that I, too, was bloodied.\n\tAt the village party later on in the day the headman made a speech welcoming me as a fellow-villager in every respect.  So, in one way, I had left home but come home!\n\tBack to Kathmandu where we had to fix our accommodation, very basic, until I had managed to meet the Vice-Chancellor.  Yes. a job did await me in the research centre and a year\u2019s contract was signed.  This, like so much more in Nepal, was a convoluted and drawn-out process: I was a foreigner and a foreigner had never been asked for by name before.  I was to get a character reference from my ambassador, which was relatively easy, but no junior functionary was willing to put his name to a document that was, and still is, I believe, unique.\n\tMeanwhile, when John Denson had his valedictory interview with the King, he spoke about my blindness and the King told one of his Personal Private Secretaries to make a note of it.  Denson also spoke to the Foreign Minister about me, which was good of him.  I haunted various offices, never showing any adverse reaction at rebuffs, refusals or recalcitrance, and pretending I had \u2018snail\u2019s eyes\u2019 to withdraw if any resistance was found before it did me a damage, so I managed to navigate the labyrinth of Nepalese bumbledom.\n\tI was given a year\u2019s contract to work at the Centre of Nepal and Asian Studies, known as Ceenas, CNAS.  My topic was to write about Nepal\u2019s contribution to the British Army.  For me that meant from the first of January 1948.  For the people who gave me the task, the National History Compilation Committee, it meant from April 1815.  I remonstrated that then it was the army of the East India Company until 1857, from when it was the Indian Army until 1947.  I prevailed but had to give a \u2018potted\u2019 history of all regiments since 1815 along with terms of service.\n\tThe first day at work was like going to a new school.  I walked the forty minutes to the CNAS building and was signing the attendance register when a bus load of the staff arrived.  Much interest must have accrued at \u2018a son of an Englishman\u2019 joining them and a flurry of questions swamped me.  My new colleagues were a different breed, Aryan Nepalis from the south rather than Mongoloid men with epicanthic eyelids from the north whom I knew, longer faced, more hirsute and less taciturn.  I answered as best I could: somebody then asked me what they should call me and I relied on the schoolboy joke \u2018anything except late for my meal\u2019, which amused them so much that I felt I had been accepted.  One of them remarked how young I looked; \u2018no strinkles, no prinkles\u2019, which I suppose was true in a way.\n\tMeanwhile on the home front, we had bought two bicycles, basic furniture, bedding and cooking materials.  Buddhiman\u2019s young and still shy wife came to join us and tried her hand at cooking European food.  This resulted in such delicacies as curried potatoes and porridge, and cake, which he husband had bought, and cabbage.\nI finished my project in eight months only to find that the National History Compilation Committee did not have it in its remit to give me any subject at all.  I was, therefore, in limbo.  I waited while two assessors were found for my work meanwhile, as long as I signed in daily, I could do what I liked.  In fact I took the chance of writing up, in preparatory book form, all I had done with the Temiar and in Borneo.\nI had problems with the bank in England not sending my money with the correct account number.  I had opened a bank account but that bank was not allowed to manipulate any changes so I had to go to the National Bank to write a request to the bank manager in Kathmandu to change the number.  I did this in the Nepali script but it was returned as invalid as \u2018foreigners do not know it.\u2019  I was called in to see the manager and only by making him laugh did he agree to the change \u2013 and that took quite a long time to arrange.\nEventually two assessors were found, several months later.  Both turned down my work and my director, the King\u2019s brother-in-law, called me in to declare my presence in CNAS no longer required.  I forgot protocol in my anger, saying that the King had permitted my joining the university and that I was helpless without Buddhiman and his wife as regards seeing properly.  \u2018You might just as well kill me here and throw my corpse out of the window\u2019 I burst out.\nBoth the director and the person with him could see I was serious so I was told to go away and think up another project \u2018by tomorrow\u2019.  The look on my face when I got home was so black that Buddhiman immediately asked me what was wrong.  I told him and he was upset.  I added that we would both pray for inspiration that night and around midnight I woke up with a linguistic idea \u2013 checking the Nepali of a dictionary published in 1931 and the newest Nepali dictionary, published in 1980.\nIt was accepted.  Some of the entries I had to unravel from the newest dictionary were abstruse, others banal.  I had already learnt that jangal, rather than meaning 'jungle', originally meant 'a place bereft of trees', but I found myself frankly ignorant on ganglions affected by yoga, invisible rings round the navel and which lunar mansions are auspicious.  Words of Sanskrit origin, modified for Nepali, were almost beyond redemption.  How was I to choose between 'raven', 'snake', 'boar', 'potter' and 'hell' for the one correct meaning, or between 'colour', 'redness', 'love', 'joy', 'anger', 'song' and 'musical harmony' for another?  Or between 'white', 'black' and 'the third fold of skin of an elephant's left buttock'?  Not that all entries to be dealt with were so complex and perplexing.\n\tEight months after my history had been condemned one of the assessors came into my room.  He sat down opposite me and sighed audibly.  He told me that his heart was heavy and he would not have \u2018failed\u2019 my project if he had understood what it was all about.\n\tI said nothing, thinking that silence was the best and safest answer.\n\tThe other assessor, later an ambassador to Laos I think the country was, also came into my room that week and asked if he could borrow my copy of the failed project.  I gave it to him and when he returned it he told me it was excellent, excellent.  The best book on Gurkhas he had yet read.  He added \u2018It is excellent as a reference book.\u2019\n\tI later learnt he had plagiarised the part of the book about \u2018terms of service\u2019 and sold it for 20,000 rupees, big money at the time.\n\tThankfully I finished my language project.  It was a massive work, resulting in my right finger thickening into a corn where my pen had rubbed the skin.  I gave both copies in to the CNAS archivist but stupidly not asking for a receipt.  It had been hoped that a conference of professors in the English department in the university, school teachers and journalists could be arranged.  Alas, I was accused of not having handed my work in.  I was dumbfounded and remonstrated but to no avail.  The secretary of the Royal Nepal Academy was so upset on my behalf when he heard about it he offered me a two-year scholarship on any subject I chose.\n\tI had long worried about what would happen to me after I left CNAS so I hit upon the idea of asking for permanent residential status.  That meant I kept my British passport so could go back to England to see my mother.  I had to make a decision, go back to England or plan on trying to stay with my surrogate family.  I chose the latter so my next task was to try and get the Nepalese government to allow my permanent residency.  That meant the King had to say \u2018yea\u2019 or \u2018nay\u2019 to my request.\n\tI found out from the Head of the Protocol Department how to address a letter to the King, wrote what I felt covered my request and, bicycling to the office at the gate of the palace, gave it in for forwarding.  I was later contacted by the appropriate department, given a non-listed phone number and for the next nine plus months rang it every two weeks as told to find out the situation.\n\tOne day the peon came into my room and excitedly told me I had to give him a photo. I always carried one so I gave it to him.  He told me he was not allowed to tell me why he wanted it but...I had paid the debt he was in since his father had died and given him a midday glass of tea to drink when he brought mine in to my office...so he told me.  The palace wanted it and to see me at 2 o\u2019clock on the morrow afternoon.  So it came about I bicycled to the palace gates exactly ten months (Nepali pregnancies are measured in lunar months so the baby is born after a ten-month pregnancy).  Every traffic light I biked past was green and exactly at 2 o\u2019clock I got to the dates \u2013 never forgetting that I never had a jungle kill or capture during my ten years in the jungle if there was not a \u20182\u2019 in the date.\nI was not only given permanent residential status but, for the first time in Nepalese history, I, a foreigner, was allowed to own a house and a piece of supporting land entirely in my own name.  I believe this was because I managed to let the King know, not personally but \u2018one away\u2019, that I had been told by a Soviet \u2018plant\u2019 in the India embassy in Vientiane that India would try and take over, de facto sed non de jure by the year 2000 AD.\n\tI wrote to the King to thank him.  At the end of October, I received a letter, headed Royal Palace, Nepal.  It was from His Majesty's Principal Private Secretary and stated:\n\tI have had the honour to submit your letter of October 18, 1985, to the gracious attention of His Majesty the King and I am commanded to thank you for your thoughtfulness in writing.  I do hope that your stay in Nepal will be rewarded with joy, peace and creativity that you so much look forward to finding in our land.\n\tThis was particularly pleasing and I reflected that, while His Majesty the King may indeed then to have been thought to be semi-divine by many Nepalis, he is also an old Etonian.\n\tThat meant I could go and settle in my new house in Pokhara that Buddhiman had gone to build so there was no need to accept the offer of a scholarship.\nMy dictionary work was found eight years later by a new director, a friend of mine.  It had been hidden on purpose.  In Nepal such action is known as \u2018crab culture\u2019: a crab latches on to another crab which wants to move somewhere else so cannot.  Quite what the registrar thought he would gain from such a negation of what I had done was never made plain.  I expect it was jealousy in that I was the only one who worked full hours and did not inflate his budget with bogus requests.  I was told by a friend I had made that had a Nepali been given my task it would have lasted three to four years with each year a bogus budget requested.  Presumably I, a foreigner, had to learn how to behave in a \u2018proper\u2019 academic fashion.\n153***\nIn November 1985 CNAS organised the preparatory four-day meeting of the embryo six nations of the South Asian Area for Regional Cooperation, known as SAARC, comprising Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.  I was invited as an observer.  On the third afternoon, late in starting, a European, walking with great determination, lacking all normal courtesies, thrust himself into a group of Nepalis demanding to know why the delay.  He was ignored.  I was nearby, wearing national dress.  When I answered this blustering individual in faultless English, he could scarcely believe his ears.\n\tHe could not believe I was an individual not an agent and my answers increased his disbelief.  He was Albert I. Bannov, the First Secretary of the Soviet embassy, who transpired to be half-Azerbaijani, half-Russian \u2013 and, I later learnt, a member of the Soviet Army's intelligence network, GRU.  I \u2018cleared\u2019 a meeting with the embassy and rang him a week later.  Was his excited reaction because he thought he had won over an agent in place, if not a defector?  I found his house without much difficulty.  After being introduced to his pleasant wife \u2013 \u2018her name is Alla, not the god Alla but the Ukrainian Alla\u2019 \u2013 I was invited to sit down in a darkened corner.  Bannov switched on the taped music, alcohol was produced which I declined with what sounded like Alla scolding for trying to force me to drink when I obviously did not want to.\n\tA tray of assorted goodies was put in front of me.  I was wearing dark contact lens and could not see any utensils.  I hesitated.  I was ordered to eat.  I dipped into the nearest of the various little compartments on the tray.  A damp stickiness clung to my fingers and I put the mess into my mouth and instantly choked on some very hot mustard.\n\tBannov asked me to find out what the British embassy\u2019s policy was towards the Chinese.  I declined, explaining my bad eyes, how I was dependent on Buddhiman, how, in turn, I was looking after Buddhiman and his family.  Bannov replied that I was more communist than he was as his only idea was to make as much money as possible and find himself a nice house in a nice district in Moscow, but he would look after Buddhiman for life if I was caught working for him and was kicked out.\n\tI left as soon as I could.  \tAmerican watchers of Bannov's residence reported me to the British embassy the very next day.\n\tBannov somehow tracked me down and asked to speak to Buddhiman.  He offered him a five-year scholarship in the Soviet Union, there and then, and was puzzled by a firm, polite yet very definite refusal.\n\tMore Soviet interference occurred when a Hero of the Soviet Union came to lecture at CNAS.  He told the packed audience how many KGB operators were working in Nepal with the aim of turning Nepal communist at its next revolution.  The result was as though each Nepali had an electric shock in their unmentionables.  The Soviet tried to back-pedal but with no effect so went on to say that his organisation was writing a new left-wing history of Nepal.\n\nA good example of how Nepalese bureaucracy works occurred when my landlord arranged for an Amstrad word processor to be bought for me from Hong Kong by the senior air hostess of the King's Flight.  Unfortunately my initials were recorded as P.J. not J.P., so that resembled a children\u2019s \u2018treasure hunt\u2019 as a Christmas party rather than a government department being serious.  First we went to the customs offices in the airport where we found that the Amstrad details were not there so we had to go to the main office in the town.  There we made out an application for an assessment to be given.  Paper and stamp were needed: we had neither so went shopping to buy them.  We had to navigate through the four grades of functionary in the department.  No 2 signed our application which we took to No 4 for another, confirmatory, letter.  We took these to No 3, to No 4, to No 2, to No 1, to No 3, to No 4, to a typist for five copies of the answer.  Then to No 4 to sign the No 5 copy, to No 3 to sign the No 4 copy, to No 2 to sign the other copies, to No 3 to initial the signatures, to No 4 to initial all the copies, to the clerk to put one copy in an envelope and to enter that fact in a ledger.  Then we went back to the airport office, where another round of musical chairs took place to change P.J. into J.P. before I became the proud possessor of a word processor.  Exhausting.  In fact, although it took us four hours, we were, in golfing terms, 'eagle' for the course...\n154***\nIn 1986 before I left CNAS I was asked by the King of Nepal\u2019s brother-in-law, \u2018Bikram\u2019, to write a book describing Nepal\u2019s ills, the \u2018tragic\u2019 rather than the \u2018magic\u2019 one might say, and how I saw Nepal \u2018rejuvenated\u2019.  I cavilled at first then said that I would put my thoughts into a book to be titled The Thrall of Nepal, the \u2018reverse image\u2019 of what I had already had published, The Call of Nepal.  I told him that I wished three advisors to vet my efforts, he himself representing the royal family, the son of the late High Priest to the king, representing religion, and the son of a Defence Minister, representing politics.\n\tIt took much time and effort to write such a book and prevented me from continuing with a book I had been asked to write, Jungle Warfare, but write it I did.  I sent each representative a copy of my draft, gave them time to read it and called a meeting in the palace where \u2018Bikram\u2019 lived.  I stressed that I would not publish it unless all three of them were prepared to \u2018stand by\u2019 me in writing lest any hostile reaction to what I wrote were to ensue.\n\tAt the meeting the political representative said that I had not gone nearly far enough, the religious representative said \u2018it hit me like a bullet\u2019 and the member of the royal family remained silent.  After tea and cakes the meeting broke up and Buddhiman and I left, wondering what the final outcome would be.\n\t The Thrall of Nepal was never published because my three advisors declined to \u2018stand by\u2019 me.  Sadly \u2018Bikram\u2019 told me he was unconvinced by what I had written but he himself could find no alternative.\n\t(When I left CNAS \u2018Bikram\u2019, the Director, invited me to a farewell party.  Buddhiman and I prinked ourselves suitably but just as we were setting out we were phoned to say the party was cancelled.  Oh!)\n155***\nMy permanent residency meant I declined the offer of a scholarship.  I went to the Royal Nepal Academy and expressed my sincere gratitude to the kind secretary for helping me so readily, packed up and thankfully moved to Pokhara where Buddhiman was working on our new house.  His wife had taken their daughter of less than a year old, up to their hill village where mother-in-law could help look after her.\n\tThe day I arrived I was called on by my one-time Gurkha Major from recruiting days.  We had \u2018kept tabs\u2019 on each other and I welcomed his visit.  He asked for money for a guest room for visiting lamas in the local Buddhist temple.  I had no spare money so it was arranged that money would be borrowed from local men and repaid when I had funds.  No interest would be raised.  Somehow the following day the news reached Special Branch of the Police and people were quizzed in detail about me and why was I interfering?  Matters were explained and the police were told I did not initiate the matter.\n\t Any European living as I was with a Nepali family was so unusual that I was an object of suspicion so I felt I should introduce myself to all relevant officials in the administration, police and army as well as to the Officer in Charge of the Indian Embassy Pension Paying Office, known as the Pension Camp.  The police wanted to know if I had made Buddhiman become a Christian because he was my surrogate son.  It appears that children in Nepal will adopt the religion of the father, whatever that happens to be.  I said such had never entered my head.  I was asked if I were a Christian and I said I was a baptised one but had taken part in all Hindu religious celebrations ever since I had joined a Gurkha battalion more than forty years earlier.  From the nods of the listeners I felt I had avoided any conflict of views.\n156***\nAfter so long a time living a regimented life, I found being a civilian strange.  I had only taken half the leave I had been entitled to during my service, unusual perhaps, but so often the job I was in did not allow my absence; even the two weeks I was away when commanding the JWS resulted in an international crisis with the Vietnamese.\n\tBut now I was a civilian, a privileged one to be sure, but a foreigner even though in the first twenty years when I went to Kathmandu by bus there was always someone I knew travelling both ways.  I started daily early-morning jogging from the house along the main road to a bridge over a river and back, about ten miles.  That raised eyebrows and when I asked why I was running even the facetious answer I gave \u2013 \u2018to see if the bridge over the river had been stolen during the night\u2019 \u2013 was normally believed.  After six months we started keeping dogs and jogging ended.  Buddhiman and I walked miles in the countryside, the dogs chasing monkeys and sometimes a jackal.  One animal they chased which never ran straight and disappeared down a hole was new to us; it turned out to be a Burmese ferret badger, of the weasel family.\n\tWe never went to same way twice in succession and such behaviour also raised suspicions about \u2018this son of an Englishman\u2019: what was he looking for?  Were he wanting to go from one place to another why not take a bus or go straight?\n\tAt that time there were three well-known English phrases, \u2018morning walk\u2019, \u2018half brain\u2019 and \u2018love marriage\u2019: almost material for a degree thesis!\n\tI was also asked to write a book on jungle warfare and on my life in Laos.  This latter I first titled Malice in Blunderland but that was changed to First In, Last Out, a title I liked less.\n157***\nIn Nepal death ceremonies are held to be of the utmost significance and take a top priority in affairs.  For a father they last for thirteen days, at a time set by a lama.  Buddhiman\u2019s wife had a miscarriage after a three-month pregnancy.  This took place in Pokhara.\n\tUp in his hill village, a hard day\u2019s walk away, lived a shaman, a one-time lance corporal in the Gurkha Military Police.  Somehow the spirits of others could enter him and he would be affected by the spirit\u2019s owner.  Around the same time as the miscarriage something got into him, making him sit, tremble, fall onto his back, then sit up again, several times.  This spirit that possessed him was a \u2018wind\u2019, a wayu in Nepali, which let the shaman know that it had been a boy but had been premature expelled from the womb.  The proper death ceremonies had not been done to it.  It let him know of tastes and violent shuddering.\n\tThe result was that the shaman called to all those relatives who observed the thirteen-day obsequies to ask them if any \u2018unauthorised\u2019 behaviour had taken place.  Apparently none had.  The only person who should have attended the meeting but was not there was Buddhiman in Pokhara.  He was sent for and asked if there had been anything like a miscarriage in his family and, if so, why and when?\n\tYes, there had been.  His pregnant wife had been round to a house and had been offered some honey.  This is not spread on bread before being eaten but taken \u2018raw.  It had been too strong for her and she had asked for a drink.  Her host had given her some undiluted squash which she drank, much to her discomfort.  Buddhiman went and collected her and, to try and ease her discomfort, sat her pillion on his motor bike and went for a spin.  All perfectly legal and above-board: two tastes and violent shuddering.\n\tThat being the case a ceremony was held and the wayu let the shaman know it was satisfied and disappeared into the ether.\n\tIf the head of a mongoose is cooked and eastern by a pregnant woman she will not have a miscarriage, so local lore has it.\n158***\nThe festival of Shivratri, normally some day in early March, commemorates the wedding of Shiva and Parvati, and the occasion that Shiva performs his divine dance, called the Tandava.  It is of great significance to many Nepalis, one aspect of which is to the childless.  A soldier I enlisted was barren after many years of marriage and he felt that, were he to perform the proper rites, he would sire a child.\n\tTo achieve this he had to undergo a most difficult religious exercise, the performance of these rites needs much stamina as the man has to stand up all night with small bowls of oil containing a lit wick, one on his head and one on each outstretched hand.  To help him he had a rope round his neck tied to his arms.  He also had his wife to help keep him from falling over and only at dawn could he relax.\n\tWithin a year he had sired a son nor was that unique: such faith works with other believers.\n159***\nNepal Army Day also falls on Shrivratri.  One year when I was invited to attend the ceremony in Kathmandu Buddhiman and I were put in the VIP seats.  Someone came to tell me that the COAS. The Chief of Army Staff, wanted to meet me immediately after the events had come to an end.  No reason was given.\n\tThere were three of us standing in line, the USA and Chinese Defence Attach\u00e9s in uniform who had got there before me.  The Chinese came over to me and, in the most exquisite English accent, asked me my full name.\n\tI wrongly answered him in Cantonese by saying \u2018ten\u2019, not realising that of course he would never lower himself enough to understand such a lowly language.  \u2018I don\u2019t understand\u2019 he said, rather crossly.  I then put one index finger upright and the other athwart it to make a \u253c, which is \u2018ten\u2019 in Chinese characters.  Rather stupid of me really, so I told him what he wanted to know.  Our conversation was stopped by the COAS giving us a parchment and a badge of Commendation.  (Mine was for my book Jungle Warfare helping the Rangers Regiment to lay down its proper role.)\n\tOnly later did I understand why he had approached me.  I had been invited to the Nepali Army\u2019s Counter Intelligence & Jungle Warfare School to lecture the jungle warfare course.  There were about fifty Nepali students and about fifteen others from Kenya, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, South Korea and two from China.  I was introduced as a linguist among other attributes and, showing off horribly, spoke to the two Chinese \u2013 who understood neither Nepali nor English! \u2013 in Cantonese.  I said that they only spoke Mandarin which I didn\u2019t and they didn\u2019t speak Cantonese so there was no point in saying anything else.\u2019  If nothing else it impressed the two students enough to mention it to their DA.\n\tI have been asked to address the Nepali Army\u2019s Command and Staff College; the Western Division\u2019s recruits (one hundred and five men, twice with six weeks in between talks, with three hundred and seventy people listening for the first time and four hundred and seventy-five the second); the civilian teaching staff of the Western Division (\u2018What subject?\u2019  \u2018Anything you like.\u2019); and cadets of the Armed Forces Police, all in Nepali.\n*\nTo show the difference between after and during the monarchy, a British corporal fitter was scheduled to come from Hong Kong to inspect some armoured cars and had to bring his his dates forward by two days.  Only the COAS himself could approve such a change.  As the corporal needed an answer by return and the COAS was with the King when the request for a change in dates came, he couldn\u2019t immediately be contacted so no answer could be given in time.  This meant that the armourned cars were not inspected.\n160***\nThe law in Nepal concerning corpses lays down that the corpse must be left as it is found until the next-of-kin comes to collect it.  There was a gruesome incident when a man hanged himself at the entrance of the Green Meadows hospital near our house in Pokhara.  This hospital is also a leprosarium and some good-natured foreign doctors worked there.  It took over a day and a night before the person legally entitled to take the away could be contacted and so corpse could not be taken down before he arrived.\nThe land we bought to build our house in Pokhara is near that leprosarium.  Ours was the only house in sight.  I learnt later that after the patients learnt that \u2018an English cor-nel saheb\u2019 had built a house nearby, their morale rose sufficiently for all of them to get better quicker.  Our area is now a thriving community, full of houses and shops.\n*\nI was at home and Buddhiman had gone to Kathmandu.  Going across some fields he saw an electric cable hanging dangerously low so with the aid of a stick he hitched it.  That caused a surge of current in a nearby house where the woman had her hand on a switch and she was immediately electrocuted.  Buddhiman went to see if the flash and bang had caused any damage and found the dead woman and felt he had to report the incident to the police.  He did and was immediately charged with murder.  I was sent for.\n\tWhen the police and Buddhiman arrived, the body was not where it had been at death because her husband had moved it.  He, therefore, was charged with murder and Buddhiman, to the delight of us both, was sent away, innocent.\n161***\nSeveral years after I had left CNAS and had settled in Pokhara I was called from my room to meet a Nepali who had come to meet me.  I did not recognise him.  He was brought a glass of tea and started lamenting the badness of the Nepalese government and the King and didn\u2019t I agree?\n\tNo, I didn\u2019t.  I knew better than to give any adverse opinion about anything sensitive so I said I hadn\u2019t found anything wrong with the government or the King.  Soon after my answer he left.\nA month or so another man came with the same question and I gave the same answer.\nBoth were similar in appearance, with a \u2018short back and sides\u2019 haircut, wore boots and were dressed in plain clothes.  Both men could only have been sent by the police to test me: was I suitable to be allowed to stay on even as a permanent resident?  But even if their haircut had not been \u2018short back and sides\u2019 I\u2019d have been canny enough not to have given any other type of answer.\nWhen some anti-government students came and asked for money to help their comrades injured by the police I declined, fearful of any government reaction against me.  Being called a coward by the angry students didn\u2019t really matter.\n162***\nLeprosy, more kindly known as Hansen\u2019s disease, is endemic in Asia.  There were nine Gurkha patients in the leprosarium north of Kuala Lumpur.  When I was working at the HQ in Kuala Lumpur (meaning \u2018muddy river junction\u2019) I would go weekly to visit them and, in another hospital, the tuberculosis patients.\n\tA most pleasant southern Indian, Dr Reddy, was in charge of the more than thousand leprosy patients and he gave me permission to visit the Gurkhas.  He took me to the ward of the one in-patient, who hadn\u2019t had a proper meal for more than a year.  The bed nearest the door had a curtain round it.  \u2018Don\u2019t look,\u2019 I was told.  \u2018A Chinese man, serving a life sentence for murder, is there.  Also, it is better to touch nothing.\u2019\n\tSneak a look I did and I saw that his back had many linear scars on it: treatment or punishment?\nI was shown the Gurkha, told not to stay too long with him and Dr Reddy departed.\nI spoke with the Gurkha, Gajendra, who knew me not.  I cajoled him soothingly trying to give him strength.  I told him I\u2019d be back a week later.\nNext week he was sitting up and after four visits he had gone to the outpatients\u2019 place.  After each visit I left feeling weak and I could see strength going into him.\nA little later my arrival coincided with a sports day and I was inveigled to run in the visitors\u2019 race.  I met Dr Reddy and asked him about Gajendra\u2019s condition, hoping for a \u2018negative\u2019 answer but wondered if it might, just, be \u2018positive\u2019.\nI was stunned at the doctor\u2019s reply of \u2018miraculous\u2019.\n163***\nTwo calendars are used in Nepal, unofficially the Gregorian and their own, known as the Bikram sambat,  which is approximately 56 years and 8 months ahead of the other.\n\tI had materially helped a school with my Community Relations budget when I was DRO and gratitude is still shown over fifty years later.  Buddhiman and I were sent an invitation for the school\u2019s anniversary celebrations which would have been discourteous to have declined.  It was in three weeks time which meant that Buddhiman could go two days\u2019 walk away on some task in a neighbouring district office.  \u2018I\u2019ll ring you on Wednesday,\u2019 he said as he left the house.\n\tWhile he was absent an apologetic master came to me to say that there had been a mistake in dates as the wrong calendar had been used and the anniversary celebration were on the Saturday, in four, not eighteen days\u2019 time.  With my bad eyes I could not go alone so I\u2019d have to call Buddhiman back when he rang.\n\tOn my return after my Wednesday morning walk I asked Bhimkumari if there had been a phone call.  No.  On Thursday, just the same and on Friday ditto.\n\tI was desperate and, as I went to shower and changed, I said out loud, \u2018Any god that hears me get him back.\u2019\n\tBuddhiman had been delayed two days and, as he was moving eastwards towards the district office, at the same time as my invocation, he heard my voice.  Father\u2019s calling me he thought, turned round and made for home.  He arrived at sunset, hot and sweaty but in time for us to go to the school\u2019s party on the morrow \u2013 as though nothing untoward had happened.\n164***\nWhen I interviewed potential recruits for enlistment my questions were based on lateral thinking.  The potential soldiers\u2019 schooling had been based on the rote method.  The grave disadvantage of the rote system of learning is that is deadens, overloads, and short-circuits the brain and is deducing powers.  Its merit is that it is a cheap method of education, especially when teachers are of poor quality.\n\tWhen Buddhiman and I were in Hong Kong on our way to China, I interviewed about a hundred of the men I had enlisted fifteen years previously to see how easy or difficult it had all been to them.  It was only useful to learn \u2018set-piece\u2019 work otherwise where mental flexibility was required, such as initiative tests or working in isolation with British troops, they felt unable properly to cope.\n\tOne sergeant told me he was the first from his area down in the Terai, Nepal\u2019s flat land in the south, to be enlisted in the British Army and how he was taken up into the mountains to be inserted into another village group of men.  He told me the name of the village and the tribe of the man who inserted him, whom he only knew as \u2018uncle\u2019.  I asked for the name of the \u2018uncle\u2019 but the man did not know it.  I asked had he been the village headman in 1967 when I visited the village?  Yes.  I asked if he had been the Regimental Sergeant Major of 5 Gurkha Dog Company.  He had been.  I asked if he had white hair.  Yes, his hair was white.  Then the name of your \u2018uncle\u2019 is Bhimbahadur, I told him.  The sergeant had to admit that, indeed, was the same he\u2019d forgotten.\n\tI have to admit I was lucky in knowing the name but the point of my telling you this is that the sergeant was not surprised at my knowing: regimental officers are meant to know such details in a Gurkha unit, as indeed when a man I had not seen or thought of for twenty years told me he was Tejbahadur, I said his last four numbers were 7481 and that when we were on operations one day in the wet he said he\u2019d smelt chicken cooking so was happy to have a change in diet but was the smell of his socks drying too near a fire, so scorching.\n\tLikewise I was about to cross the airfield in Pokhara on my way home, long before it was fenced off, and I saw a Nepali of my age looking at me.  He said \u2018I was in 1/1 GR\u2019 and that was forty years and one month since I\u2019d left it.  I asked him his regimental number and he gave me the number the Indians had given him.\u2019\n\t\u2018No,not that long number.  The number you had when I was with you.\u2019\n\tHe had to think for quite a time before answering \u20182493.\u2019\n\tThat mad me also think for quite a time.  \u2018Your name is Tulsabahadur.\u2019\n\tYes, that was his name but he showed no surprise at my remembering it, after all, the battalion is a fmily.\n\tI rashly continued \u2018You were in the MT Platoon.\u2019\n\tHe shook his head, \u2018No, saheb, only a reserve driver in a rifle company.\u2019\n165***\nOn our flight to Bej Jing, \u2018northern capital\u2019, Buddhiman was fascinated to see that fields were all in squares and wondered why.  I put that down to \u2018collective farming\u2019.  After passing through immigration I needed the toilet but could see no signs; those on duty didn\u2019t understand my Cantonese so my only ploy was \u2018play acting\u2019: it worked and I was allowed back outside again where the one toilet was.\n\tWalking around we were fascinated to see elderly men throwing pellets into the air and letting their tame birds fly up and catch them.  The birds had their necks tied so as not to swallow the pellets. We saw more elderly men flying kites and were invited to try our skill.  Nowhere did we see a smile.  Buddhiman wore national Nepali dress which intrigued people: nobody understood \u2018Nepali\u2019, which I pronounced as I had been taught in Cantonese as \u2018Loi Pak Yi\u2019 but [King] Birendra and Himalayas, known as \u2018Pilinda\u2019 and \u2018Similaya\u2019 were understood so our interrogators knew where we had come from.\n\tWe went to the Great Wall and walked along it at normal speed, thanks to our morning walks.  We so no one else walking as we did.  We had a meal with the Nepalese ambassador, an old friend, where we met a Nepalese scholar who had been a Communist in Nepal.  Now no longer: the nepotism, corruption and inefficiency had weaned him completely away from that persuasion.\n166***\nThe Maoist troubles that swept the country, especially in the far west, did not shock me as much as they did most people, especially the government.  When I was doing my CEDAR trek in 1976 I saw a potential Laotian situation \u2018casting its shadow before it\u2019.  I think the Maoists, \u2018Maobadi\u2019 as they are known, saw themselves as Nepalese \u2018Robin Hoods\u2019 in Chinese vogue on a crusade to right wrongs of continuous exploitation of the people, financial impropriety, abuse of office and neglect of commons decencies when dealing with inferiors, especially by government officials, traders and school teachers.  They saw that corruption came from the top, ergo they wanted to get rid of the monarch and have a presidency.  Even so, \u2018communism\u2019, except as misnomer for \u2018social democracy\u2019 in whatsoever guise it is to be found, more apply resembles delayed light from stars almost extinct than a new firmament in its own  right.  It was more a policy of departure than for renewal: Nepalese politics were rinsed, not laundered.\n\tI kept well away from it all.  On one afternoon walk with my dog on open, flat ground, I was approached by a man who came up to me, furtively looked left and right before saying he was a \u2018Mao\u2019 man, looking for an ambush position.\n\tI looked so blank he asked me if I knew \u2018Mao\u2019 and I said the only \u2018mau\u2019 I knew were in India, \u2018mau\u2019 being the Hindi for railway engines.\n\tHe dutifully corrected me.  \u2018Have you heard of the Chinese Mao?\u2019 he asked.\n\tI admitted that I had and, unnecessarily, added that Mao had probably not heard of me.\n\tIn fact I was one of the small handful of foreigners whom the Maobadi left alone on purpose.  I was told that I had no enemies (but who and where is that person with none at all?).  On the surface I was by now accepted as part of the furniture by all who speak to me around Pokhara although I well knew that oriental obfuscation and flattery could, and usually did, hide true feelings.  I was especially popular with the children for whom I was a walking source of tricks: making mice squeak and pigs grunt in their heads, playing tunes on my walking stick, wobbling my knees, ears and eyebrows, talking in two voices and putting my finger up my nose.  I am considered benignly eccentric, a proof of inner power to many Asians, and relatively harmless.  I never complain, criticise or offer advice; just as well with my irrevocably failing eye sight and Nepal being my refuge and my wonderful family my \u2018last nest\u2019.\n\tBuddhiman and I went to our mountain house during the cease-fire.  We had not been there for two years as sometimes the Maoists used it, sometimes the police and at other times the army so it was wiser to  keep away.  The village welcomed us in a way I had never seen before and I do not exaggerate that if the King of Nepal himself had been welcomed only the bunting on the banners would have been different.  We were welcomed by five virgins: the first sprinkled us with holy water, the next tied a sacred cord round our necks, the third held a beaker of curds and guided the vessel to our lips to let us drink some, the fourth put a holy rice \u2018tika\u2019 on our foreheads and the last lass garlanded us.  We sat behind a table that had twenty-five candles on it.  The women from all around came to dance and sing in our honour.  Both of us were profoundly touched.\n167***\nOne day an English woman walked into our house unannounced and sat herself down.  We gave her a cup of tea and a biscuit and out came her story: she was a nurse in Aldershot and all her patients asked her if she knew me.  Before reading The Call of Nepal she had thought that \u2018an ignorant colonel\u2019 had written it but on reading it she changed her mind so she had decided to come and see me on her next visit to Nepal.\n\tShe said she knew she had been a Gurung in a previous incarnation, had been ill, had gone to where sick people were looked after and allowed to die.  A couple of years ago she had visited Kathmandu, had been ill and taken to a hospital \u2018which I recognised as the one I had died in before so I refused to be treated.\u2019\nShe asked me how many children would I have had since I had so many without being married?  The only answer I could think of was that, had she been around, she would have known.\nAfter she left us I remembered that the wife of a 1/1 GR subedar had told Buddhiman that she believed he and I had been related in a previous incarnation.  Buddhiman then told me about his hill village shaman, Mandhoj Dura, who could see into the past.  He would go up to his village to ask him the three questions I wanted answer to; was Buddhiman my son during my last incarnation? Will he be my son in my next incarnation?  Who my \u2018then\u2019 wife was now?  Being almost stone deaf I had written my questions out and asked Buddhiman to go and show them to him the evening before. \nBefore he went to ask those questions Buddhiman told me what he knew about Mandhoj.  By the age of nine he was a normal, good mannered and hard working lad, now different for other boys.  Early one morning he went out of the house but had not returned by the evening, nor did he come back the next day.  He was not at the house of a neighbour.  As his parents were worried they called in the local shaman to see if he knew where their son was.  He went into a trance and, shaking, called on the deities and spirits of the surrounding forest to let him know where young Mandhoj had disappeared.  The answer was that the lad was safe and unharmed, with a spirit of the forests, a ban jha\u00f1kri, and would return home.\n\tNext morning Mandhoj did come back, happy, smiling, well fed.  He had left the house as normal but was not sure what happened afterwards.  He must have gone to sleep and had woken up in a cave somewhere in the forest, warm, comfortable and happy.  He had been well looked after, quite by whom or what he was unable to say, and had been fed with delicious food, but again quite what it was he could not describe.  But he had been taught how to read the future divinations, how to communicate with the...and here he was not sure whether they were spirits of the dead or of the unborn.\n\tBuddhiman came back saying we both had to be present so I went up to the village for the session.  Mandhoj came on the morrow at dawn, the best time of day for him to perform, carrying a bag. Inside and so out of the cold, we all sat on the floor.  A plate was produced on which rice was put and Mandhoj put a small goddess (strangely a Hindu one but one of whose epithets is of the Buddha, yet Mandhoj is neither, but an animist) on the rice, as was a rosary.  On the left of the plate was the bag in which he had brought the goddess and rosary which now only contained some leaves.  On the right was a receptacle on which burning embers from the fireplace were put.  On this raw and precious incense, from up in the mountains, made strong and thick smoke.  We three sat together, cross-legged in front; the other two with us, the man and woman of the house, sat apart.\n\tMandhoj started chanting, using language I started to understand but which trailed off into meaningless mumbling.  The spirit was being called down and Buddhiman and I were being introduced. After a short while Mandhoj, hands clasped tightly in front of him, started violently to tremble.  Mostly his hands were in front of his chest but sometimes they rose to head level.  Then the spirit entered him and it started to talk through him, his voice having a clearer and different timbre than when normal or when the spirit was being invoked.\n\tThen the answers came out: Buddhiman and I had been uterine brothers, not son and father, in a Christian community to the east, working as sweepers, both of us very good men.  My mind raced; to the east lay Kathmandu and, up to 1768, six Capuchin monks had been there for over a century.  We became separated and simply had to meet in this incarnation, but as son and father.  If we are both pure in this life, not only will my only perceived task, writing, be successful but we will be uterine brothers once more in our next incarnation.  If that were to happen, we will both be allowed respite from this mortal coil and can join the godhead.\n\tWhat did emerge from Mandhoj's mouth was that, at their primeval level, both Hinduism and Christianity did not contradict one another.  By the end of the second question Mandhoj was so tired and dripping with sweat that he could not sustain his trance and I felt asking the third question was unfair.  I still do not know the answer as to my notional wife.\nOut of his trance, he talked about what had been relayed through him. Surprisingly, for a brief spell he clearly heard what we were saying before his deafness re-asserted itself.  We thanked him.  He staggered off to his own house, physically drained.\n\tThat he had the power of prophecywas proved time and time again.  He himself became a naik in the Assam Regiment and married Buddhiman\u2019s aunt on his first leave.  He became almost completely deaf when his foot stuck in a stirrup as he was getting off a horse and it ran away, dragging him for a mile.  He must have broken both eardrums.  He was lucky not to lose his life.\n\tAs an example of his extraordinary power: when a young man, Singabahadur, was told by Mandhoj that it was better not to enlist in the Gurkha Contingent of the Singapore Police.  Enlist he did and the nearer he got to Singapore the mistier it became, so was soon returned to an unmisty Nepal.  Singabahadur then asked Mandhoj what would happen if he joined the Indian Army.  He would not get his full pension, otherwise no problem.  Thirty-two years later, Honorary Captain Singabahadur Gurung was only allowed the pension of an Honorary Lieutenant.\n*\nOn another occasion Buddhiman had the chance to visit a, to him, completely unknown shaman when he was in another part of the country.  This man has been telling people their history and their future for forty years.  Then he was seventy-three years old and wishes to give it up but public pressure prevented it.  He foretold the royal family being wiped out long before it happened and was put in jail because of it but was later forgiven.  Buddhiman waited in the queue to see him for over six hours.  When it was his turn, he gave the man some money and put some rice in his hand.  The man played around with it for a moment or so and told Buddhiman that his \u2018father\u2019 was a white man, of robust health who would live a full and natural life while the father who sired Buddhiman had died\u2026and then came out exact details of the family.\n*\nAnother example of this ability is when a friend of mine, a retired Colonel of Gurkhas, came to Kathmandu and had to visit the chief policeman.  Waiting with him were two Buddhist priests and my friend asked them their business.  They had been called to see the policeman to tell him about the state of his health.  My friend then said, \u2018what about me?\u2019 so one of the men put his finger on his pulse and a short while later told him that he was fine but that he had recently damaged his shoulder.  Which was true but there was nothing about my friend\u2019s gait or carriage to indicate a hurt of four months previously.  Indeed, the people out here have something folk in the west seem to have lost.\n168***\nI wanted to write an article on ghost stories so sent a message to that effect to the four nearest Area Welfare Centres asking for anyone who could tell me some to be there on a certain day.  No one ever turned up as knowledge of such an esoteric subject seems to have died out.  At our last port of call the officer in charge was one whom I had enlisted and was now on pension.  Not having been able to get a story teller, he had asked a shaman to come and see us.  He was a Tekbahadur Chhetri, aged around fifty years.  Buddhiman asked him how he had become a shaman and he said that, when a youth he found himself walking, alone, and finding himself in places he knew not.  One night when he was about nine years of age something like lightning flashed and he was picked up and put in a pond in a field, into some mud up to his head.  Only on the third day was he rescued.  The clothes he had been wearing were not found.\n\tAs he recovered from his ordeal he found he could see the souls of the dead, especially of new-born infants whose unwanted bodies had been drowned.  He trembled when the moon started to wax and to wane.  He could read the past and the future but only stroking, for several minutes, exactly one pound of unhusked rice, in a small mound on a plate, with the second and third fingers of his right hand, enchanting the while.\n\tHe knew nothing about either us except we were \u2018father and son\u2019, had never heard of us nor had he ever seen us.  He was given his pound of rice and when he had finished muttering he told us that Buddhiman and I had been together in a previous life but had become separated, his details clearly coinciding with Mandhoj\u2019s; Buddhiman\u2019s father had died of lockjaw when he ran a piece of wood into his foot when ploughing \u2013 true; Buddhiman never swore at anyone \u2013 true; gave blessings to people \u2013 he does; does not eat certain types of meat \u2013 true; will look after me as I have given him everything, even my soul and I can\u2019t manage without him \u2013 true.\n\tBuddhiman then asked him about me.  Tekbahadur stroked the rice for twelve and a half minutes then told me that I would become a citizen of Nepal; that I had given all my money to my Nepalese family and had none myself \u2013 true\u2019 I was unmarried.  My first attempt when young should have been successful so all the other attempts were bound to be unsuccessful \u2013 Jenny and I met as we embarked at Singapore on the boat for my first leave after more than four years and she was going back to England with her parents.  We fell in love and became engaged to marry.  My father dissuaded me as I was too young and, in any case, the army then did not allow officers to marry until they were thirty.  We never met again.  My four or five other attempts to get married did indeed all fail.  Tekbahadur continued by saying I had no sins in me and did what I said I\u2019d do; I would be reincarnated.  If I had been really good as a man, if not as a bird.  This last made me wonder if that is why I can imitate a dove, the Malayan Great-eared nightjar, a cock, a turkey a cuckoo and get an answer from each one.  Anent this last bird, a New Zealand telephone advertisement used my making such a noise with my hands to a group of reporters at the Jungle Warfare School: after I had asked for some remuneration it was taken off.\n169***\nIn a way it was Buddhiman\u2019s fault as there was no actual need for it!  In a Nepali\u2019s 84th year a religious ceremony often takes place so that the rest of that person\u2019s life may be spent in peace, safe in the knowledge that due preparations have been made.  It was the best and most sincere way he knew of showing his gratitude for an undreamt of life for him and the family he had raised over the past thirty-two years that we had by then been together, the last twenty-nine as my eyes.  In a way it was, for him, my apotheosis.  For the past six months, the Lady of the House, Bhimkumari, had been organising the making of 108,000 wicks that were needed to be used during the proceedings.  She had a bevy of ladies to help her, and a thousand per time per person was the ration.\n\tI was asked, or rather Buddhiman told me, that I really ought to undergo such treatment.  He thought of it as religious, I more in the social line of events, despite, unlike most other baptised Christians, already being an honorary Hindu and an honorary Buddhist.  It took a lot of organising: first a suitable date had to be found from the horoscope.  The date chosen from the celestial almanac as far back as the previous September was 12 December.  I was happy with that date as it was the eighty-fifth anniversary of my dear elder brother \u2013 a genius in anyone's language \u2013 being born.  Four thousand five hundred invitations were issued two thousand five hundred locally and two thousand for our friends in the hills.  \u2018My\u2019 day was also a day of marriages so many folk had to go to one such, an all day function.  About two thousand two hundred people turned up and, after the event, many people grumbled to Buddhiman that they were not invited.  All had to be fed and given cups of tea or coffee during the day and well after dark.  Invitations were pieces of betel nut enclosed in an invitation card \u2013 all most traditional.\n\tBefore prayers started on December 11 a large red banner, with white letters announcing the ceremony and in whose name it was being performed, was strung out over the gate leading into our \u2018compound\u2019, as gardens out here are named.  Buddhiman and others had to spend the night outside on a vigil, so their eyes were tired by dawn.  I was spared that.  I was not all that involved in the early morning so I went for a walk.  Most unusually, I was almost dragged into a woman\u2019s garden to be shown her idols, multi-headed snake gods, grotesque elephant gods and many others.  I was told to enter the house and was taken into a room that had shelves full of traditional medicine for women's illnesses and more gods strewn around on the floor and on shelves than I had ever seen in one place before.  The woman, sitting cross-legged, went into a trance and fell backwards, nearly hitting her head on the floor.  She then squirmed backwards out of the door and I heard her choking and spitting.  On her \u2018awakening\u2019 she said she was taking the evil out of my body (I had recently been plagued by shingles).  She then sat cross-legged again and started laughing hysterically.  Had any evil spirits been left behind? I wondered, in my ignorance.  Having been in Laos I had thought that I would never again be in a position of feeling utterly lost, not knowing how to react.  After maybe twenty minutes the woman's mother came in and gave me a cup of hot milk and I managed to make my way out, despite protestations.  Back to my own house, the religious incantations, incense and intricacies almost seemed tame.\n\tThen, on the twelfth, matters started in earnest.  I had to clean myself ceremoniously, that is by having a cold shower after I arose.  This I did at around half past four in the morning.  It was not the penance it might have been to others as I have to be awake around that time for my glaucoma-stricken eyes to have a drop put in them.  And anyway it made me glow!  I dressed in national fig and was told by an Englishman who came to watch that, for all the world, l looked like an albino Brahman.\n\tPriest, prelates and pastors were then the order of the day.  The actual praying was done by Buddhiman and Bhimkumari: I seemed to be there as an important \u2018extra\u2019, to be prayed over at intervals.  There were religious men of five faiths, Christian (Roman Catholic \u2013 2 and whatever brand has \u2018pastor\u2019 \u2013 1), Hindu \u2013 11 pundits (4 full time and 7 acolytes 'under instruction), Buddhist \u2013 2, Moslem \u2013 1 and B\u00f6n, the ancient type of proto-Buddhism\u2013 2.  In no way did I object to such a broad template as it accorded with my deist leanings but an atavistic twinge of religious conscience did grip me once, early on.  Only the animist priest was unable to come because he had to be in Kathmandu.  None of us undergoing the ceremony was permitted to have a meal before we started, only at the end.  I had a \u2018cup of wet\u2019 some time before dawn and another after three hours of \u2018service\u2019 when those sitting cross-legged wanted to stretch their limbs and rest their chanting voice.  Then there was another session which was the main Hindu bit.  Seven young men, six of them still boys, came from a Hindu school at the other end of town to \u2018swell the prayer voltage\u2019.  The eldest came and stood over me, flicking water from a brass \u2018lota\u2019 with a sprig.  After one lot I shivered and turned to the flickerer and recited a Nepali saw, \u2018the goat has shivered [because the god has entered it] so there is nothing left [before its head is cut off] except for something to go wrong!\u2019 then, much to his surprise, queried \u2018Surely you\u2019re not going to lop my head off when you've finished?\u2019  I fear I put him off his rhythm.  When that part of the prolonged ceremony was over, Buddhiman and I had the other religion\u2019s ministers to give us blessings.  The Hindu bit was all in Sanskrit, the Buddhist bit in Tibetan, the Moslem in Arabic and only the B\u00f6n and the Christians used Nepali.  I was lost in a maze of ritual, never quite knowing which hand to raise, where to sit or what to say and when not to say it.  Whether I believed what was happening was not germane but as long as the local gods did \u2013 i.e. \u2018society\u2019, that was all that mattered.\n\tBeing an honorary Hindu and an honorary Buddhist already, reminded me of what my paternal grandmother taught me as a child: '\u2019Said the bishop when asked to a feast/Where he ate almost nothing but yeast/I may not rise as high/As my God in the sky/But I want to get started at least.\u2019  If the Supremes Force has any anthropomorphic characteristics I hope one of them is a sense of humour!\n\t(Will I be shot if I say I comfort myself by the thought that I am not an apostate or an apologist but rather an apostle of apodictic apagoge that God is One?  Probably yes.)\n\tBy then it was after 1 o\u2019clock in the afternoon and the queue of people waiting for the next part of the ceremony \u2018dog tailed\u2019 in the compound and spread out onto the road, the entrance path being 30 yards long.  After giving a short address over a \u2018system\u2019, thanking the guests for turning up, saying that only two days before was the sixty-fourth anniversary of my time with the Nepalese and a bit more, it was my turn to bless all the two thousand two hundred guests by daubing their forehead with a bit of red rice and giving them the ritual blessing.  This took more than five hours.  I was given fifteen Nepali hats, as many white silk scarves as there were guests and over a hundred woolen shawls, which are a high mark of respectability.  One of the family stood next to me to take each shawl off, singly or a few at a time, so that I could see what I was doing with my fingers from a silver-plated bowl of rice for daubing foreheads and not to be suffocated.  Some people tied a turban round my head, some put a garland of flowers round my neck and many daubed me with red rice so my face and fingers were blatantly red.  Some brought bunches of flowers, some presents wrapped up, others pieces of leaves and fruit, chiefly apples, bananas and oranges.  I was tired by the time it was dark, as, although I did sit down three times for a minute or so, I couldn\u2019t reach the targets\u2019 forehead so had to stand up again.  Towards the end two family members stood close to me as book ends to keep me upright \u2013 empty stomach and soon after shingles.  My fingers were bright red \u2013 and still were for a day or so afterwards.  I was told to leave and went up to my room where Bhimkumari brought me a delicious bowl of hot soup.  However, while slurping it I was called down again as some late comers arrived.  Five people came from Kathmandu just for the ceremony.  Eventually at around 7.30 I was told to leave.  As catering was continuous from around 1 o'clock till late evening, I was brought a plate of food up to my room.  I was asleep by 8 o\u2019clock that night but Buddhiman and his wife, along with many others, had to spend another night\u2019s vigil in the cold.  (The longest I have been without sleep is from 2 o\u2019clock. on the Tuesday to 8 o\u2019clock on the Friday evening, except for four hours, in 1948 at the start of the Malayan Emergency: the longest asleep I have been was from nine o\u2019clock in the evening, Wednesday, till six in the morning on the Friday, in 1964 in Borneo.)\n\tThe local \u2018tent house\u2019 had brought cloth to make roofs in various places.  There was a stage where a cultural show for three hours blared out its songs and dances.  The chair I had to sit on was like a mini-throne, plush, ornate and with silver legs!  We had thought of getting some caterers to arrange the food but no: our local social society came for free and certain individuals were responsible for various chores, cutting and chopping vegetables, getting firewood, cooking the rice and more rice when that lot was finished and more after that \u2013 all for free and so saving us around \u00a31,600.  Whenever there is a function, of welcome, of a picnic, of marriage, of death, of whatever, all help each other so that each person is paid back for the effort he has already made.   If one definition of religion is \u2018conduct directed at salvation\u2019, I am still wondering in which direction I am going.\nAfter the ceremony the man, or woman, would be seen as so \u2018purified\u2019 that he must think, see or hear no evil (hollow laugh), nor is he allowed to tie any rope round an animal\u2019s neck not or bind it to a post.  Neither is it allowed for him to put a dog on a lead.\n\tI went for a walk on the morrow and was told by several people that the local radio station had announced it and the local press had printed it.  I had never seen so many smiles or heard so many nice words.  One person stopped his car and got out, another his motor cycle, a third his pushbike, and many came out of their houses or shops to congratulate me.  Most noticeable were the youngsters who made a point of coming up to me to say a word of thanks for the invitation.  Others were peeved that they had had no invitation.  To them I apologised and told them how many invitations had been given out...  But to show my sorrow I would invite them to my hundredth birthday party \u2013 at last a smile.\n\tTwo days before I had been at the final of the High School basket ball championship I had funded for the past six years.  After the match I was given a framed \u2018thanks\u2019, not on paper but on silvered metal and, over-egging the cake, a picture of me was printed in the next day\u2019s paper with a note about both the basket ball and the \u2018eighty-fourth\u2019.  One local radio station called me in for an interview to answer the question, \u2018Why did you, a foreigner, submit to a purely Nepalese ceremony?\u2019  Once there the interviewer told me that we\u2019d talk naturally about my life.  I thought that it would all last about twenty minutes at the most.  Trying to keep up with his questions and digging up the past I did not notice the time slipping by.  Some of the questions that were asked were a tad too inquisitive (why was I a single man?) and I needed my wits about me to deflect a hoped-for answer and retain my aura, false or not, of respectability.  I was tired by the end and surprised to learn that we had been talking for an hour and a half.  The programme went out in four parts on four consecutive Saturday mornings and Tuesday evenings.  After every delivery I was assailed on my morning walks by the odd bus and taxi driver, motor cyclist and pedestrian who stopped to say how much they had enjoyed listening to what I had said as well people from the safety of a shop or house.  It was a strange feeling to walk along the road and hear my voice come from a shop or house, a car radio or a hand-held transistor radio.  Buddhiman, who travels more widely than do I, also came back with stories of who and how many had said what and where \u2018twas said.  After the second broadcast someone from our village in the mountains used a mobile phone to say how much it had been appreciated even there \u2013 twenty-five air miles away.  It is difficult to calculate how many folk listened in but, on being asked why I had not got citizenship yet \u2013 \u2018Don\u2019t ask me, ask him who has not given it to me\u2019 \u2013  ex-servicemen vowed to \u2018do something about it\u2019.  \u2018t must be a Nepali talking as no foreigner can talk like that,\u2019 was passed on to me more than once.\n\tAnd if that was not enough, ten days later Radio Nepal suddenly called on me without any warning, asking for a short interview for a programme for old people on \u2018how I keep so young when so old\u2019.\n\tOne result of having experienced such an occasion is that many people expect blessings that will be efficacious.  I was asked to bless a young girl for her exams and I wished her to get \u20181st Division\u2019, which she did, to her unbounded joy.  Yet another lass, about to take her all important School Leaving Certificate, asked for a blessing and, when she failed her maths paper, blamed my blessing for not being efficacious.  I told her that, as I had not blessed the person who marked her maths paper, I could not be blamed \u2013 and she accepted that answer, took another blessing and passed!\n\tAnd when, twenty-five years later, I met the next Indian Army chief, he asked for a blessing on our parting; and even a Brahman called me up to Kathmandu to bless his daughter at her wedding.\n170***\nOne morning a lieutenant colonel in the Royal Nepal Army told me he was bringing a team to film me on \u2018tourism in Pokhara\u2019, a subject about which I know little and care less.  Half a dozen folk turned up and I was spoken at for about twenty minutes, asked questions about myself and why I was in Nepal.  Then came a question that I feared: \u2018Why is the country in a mess and what to do about it?\u2019 or words to that effect.  I gave an answer to the effect that the Nepalis muddled up their \u2018k\u2019s and \u2018n\u2019s in a certain word.  The nearest to an English example would be \u2018cure\u2019 written when \u2018curse\u2019 was meant and vice versa.  Not only did the TV crew burst out laughing but the questioner looked as though I had given him the very gentlest rebuke.\n\tTwo and a half months later during my morning walk, I was stopped twelve times and a total of eighteen people told me that I had been on TV the night before.  All smiled at my wisdom, one man even shaking my hand.  Later I learnt that a number of channels carried longer or shorter \u2018clips\u2019 as more and more people came up to me and Buddhiman to say that they had seen the interview and appreciated it.  Some of the village lads who saw my library books (and kukris hanging round the walls) could not believe any private person would have so many and thought that the interview had taken place in a book shop.\n171***\nThe thought of blindness has ever haunted me, especially in the six months it took to learn how to walk with tunnel vision specs, half the power of binoculars, and hanging onto Buddhiman lest I fell.  \n\tYet Dame Fortune managed a smile: as I left Nepal at the end of my service in 1982 I was asked to join the university\u2019s Research Centre for Nepal and Asian studies in Kirtipur as an Assistant Reader.  I accepted with gratitude and joined six months later.  At a symposium for \u2018higher Nepalese learning\u2019 the youngest royal prince was the Chief Guest and the Vice-Chancellor pulled me out to be presented.  \u2018Why do you want to stay here in Nepal?\u2019 he asked.  \u2018Because I want to repay all that I have learnt of how to bear hardship and fortitude from your subjects, Sarkar, by some personal contribution,\u2019 thinking both of ten years spent in the jungle and my eyes.\n\tIn 1985 the outgoing ambassador, the late John Denson, asked the Protocol Officer how I could approach the king about permanency in Nepal.  The result, after ten nail-biting months, was being given Permanent Residential Status with the unique privilege of being the only foreigner ever in the history of the country to be a house- and land-owner.  That granted, I started life with Buddhiman, Bhimkumari and a growing family, in Pokhara.\n\tHow to stay permanently in Nepal for survival forever still worried me as, before requesting citizenship a preliminary 20-year stay with a non-tourist visa (but not for any foreign organisation) was mandatory.  I got mine because I had been in the university.\n\tAfter twenty years I was blithely told that the probationary time was only fifteen years.  There were four aspects to be covered and I had only completed the one of sufficient time in incubation.  The other three were giving up the passport of the Land of one\u2019s Birth, a good knowledge of spoken and written Nepali, and making sufficient contributions for \u2018general welfare\u2019, plus always having a minimum of $20,000 in the bank.\n\tIn 2002 I renounced my British citizenship by giving in my passport and paying \u00a320 for the privilege before asking for Nepalese citizenship.  The process is Byzantine and awe-inspiring in its complexity, frustrating in its obscurity and time-consuming in its progress from ward to sub-metropolis to district to ward to sub-metropolis to district to district police to ward police to a \u2018five good men and true\u2019 jury sitting with me and a sub-inspector to pronounce on whether I was a fit subject for being awarded citizenship \u2013 each signing twice on two hand-written copies of what the policeman had noted \u2013 to ward police to district police to district.  Matters came to a halt as the proper form for the obligatory covering letter forwarding the paperwork to the Ministry was not in stock nor were there any forms in the Ministry itself.  Eventually the \u2018special covering letter\u2019 was allowed to be handwritten.  Twice I had to have my thumb prints on the page, with the left thumb on the right of the pair and the right thumb on the left.  On the eve of the very last signature of approval all local government officials were dismissed in a political shake-up.  Against all odds I did get \u2018that\u2019 signature but, even so, the whole lot was again nearly scuppered because the ink was blue, not red.  Now a six-month wait for an answer thought I in my total ignorance.\n\tLater on that year I was invited to the opening ceremony of a seven-day religious marathon, in a village, where I had materially helped its school, to raise funds to establish a \u2018campus\u2019 in the existing school complex.  There a senior and well-known pundit told me he was the chairman of the World Hindu Council and had heard I had been a help to various people and places, so he was inviting me to become an honorary member of his organisation.  He would give me a certificate to that effect and tell the king, with whom he was in regular contact.  To be a Hindu one must be born Hindu and there is neither method nor ceremony for conversion as it is technically impossible to convert to Hinduism, it being as much a social system as a religion.  So, after deep consideration, I found I was not unsympathetic to the idea as by then I regarded all \u2018historical\u2019 religions and their many divine and religious \u2018personalities\u2019 \u2013 whose original had a larger than normal essence of the \u2018divine spark\u2019, with many as allegoric icons and the name of the religion being irrelevant provided that the correct \u2018path\u2019 was recognized as such \u2013 and I wished to embrace wisdom wherever I could find it.  Nor do I believe that a showing of the 'divine spark\u2019 is necessarily exclusive to one individual once a millennium.  For me it boils down to a leaning towards a \u2018literalist\u2019 approach of holy scriptures and beliefs, which I have eschewed more and more over the years, or towards a gnostic bias with a Deist approach.  My Christianity is, therefore, \u2018ethical\u2019 in content as I have nothing better, nor will I.  Added to that Buddhiman assured me that being an honorary Hindu did not mean I had to accept the Hindu \u2018panoply\u2019 literally or claim that faith as my own.  Having already been elected an honorary life member of the local \u2013 and biggest in Nepal \u2013 Buddhist Crematorium Committee,I felt that were Christianity only composed of an Old Testament God, I\u2019d \u2018had it\u2019 aleadry.\n\tIn 2003 the pundit told me that when he last went to put a \u2018tika\u2019 on the king\u2019s forehead he mentioned that I had not heard the outcome of my quest for Nepalese citizenship.  By then I was even more fully aware that every day with sight was a bonus.  I knew of nowhere else I could be looked after with so much love and happiness, so my Pokhara home had to be my \u2018last nest\u2019.\n\t(I had recently heard about an Englishman who had applied for Turkish citizenship, the only such case ever apparently.  He had to be certified as sane before being recommended as suitable for such a status and that meant visiting a Turkish psychiatrist who could find nothing wrong with him.  \u2018You are perfectly sane: why did you come to me?\u2019 he asked.  \u2018I want to become a Turkish citizen,\u2019 the Englishman explained.  \u2018Then you must be mad\u2019, countered the psychiatrist but I do not know if that officially barred the Englishman from becoming Turkish or not.)\n\tIn 2004 I was made an official advisor for the royal visit to Pokhara in April-May.  I had been told I would be granted an audience so I could ask the King about my citizenship as by then I had had no answer in twenty-two months.  But the royal programme was curtailed by two weeks so there were no audiences for any of the one hundred and thirty-seven people who had put their names down for one.  Apparently the King told one local official who did manage an audience and who asked about me that he thought that he had already authorised it for me.  My inability to get a decision and the sadness in the country generally was always with me, like an elusive shadow hovering on the very edge of my field of vision, sensed by never seen.\n\tThat same year in one week one English-language and three Nepali-language newspapers published articles about my lack of citizenship.  According to the Palace, the Home Minister and the ambassador, no new citizenship papers were to be given to anyone until some new law was enacted \u2013 there was no likelihood of such a law as long as the country was in Maoist turmoil.\n\tIn 2005 King Gyanendra visited Pokhara and I put in an official application for my quest to be looked into.  When he took a walk along the road Buddhiman gave him another copy with a photo of the family inside the envelope.  Also I had a long talk with the \u2018\u2019Lord Lieutenant\u2019 prior to the royal visit and gave him a copy of the official paperwork as well as an application to be considered an honorary citizen \u2013 \u2018belt and braces\u2019.  The king had a private meal with the 'LL' and ordered photostat copies of all the paperwork which he put into his inside coat pocket.\n\tYet nothing happened.\n\tOn 26 March 2006 the largest and oldest high school in Pokhara held its Golden Jubilee.  The king and queen were chief guests.  I, who had helped it and its Blind Section financially, was invited and given the privilege of being in the receiving line to welcome Their Majesties.  Each had to be given a bouquet of flowers as well as a namast\u00e9 in the act of presenting them.  I was told to speak in Nepali.  I said, \u2018Your Majesty, I have been with Nepalis for 61 years, three months and 16 days.  I have completely given up everything in England and my humble prayer is for citizenship and that you will order it.\u2019  He nodded and mumbled a yes as I gave him his flowers but passed on too quickly for me to give him the paperwork still in my inner coat pocket.  I had to be ready for the Queen who followed in quick succession to receive her bouquet.  I managed to get my petition delivered through the Lord Lieutenant but, in spite of my written request being the fifth that had found its way into the palace office, I got no answer.  I was sometimes asked if such did not send me ballistic and give me duodenal ulcers?  My answer was that when any problem that would act thus to a Westerner I looked on it as a Nepali would so be unconcerned and were a Nepali to become ballistic I looked on it as a Westerner would so it left me unruffled.  Then a new lot in the government came up with the suggestion that no foreigner be allowed to have Nepalese citizenship.  Nobody acted on the suggestion because, in fact, that was already the case.\n\tLater that same year, keeping in touch with local officialdom, I showed my paperwork to the senior functionary in the district office.  He read it thoroughly, then accused me of breaking the Law of the Land.  I asked him how so?  I was accused of not having had a visa stamped in my passport for five years, a grave transgression.  I explained that the very process of citizenship could not start until the original passport has been surrendered, with a certificate from the original country's Home Office to that effect.  I was ordered to get my passport back, have it stamped five times and return it, in other words, wholly negating the original process by making me start afresh.  He would not have it otherwise.  I left the office, speechless \u2013 a most rare occurrence for me.\n\tThe world is divided in to two types of people: those who say \u2018What to do?\u2019 and those who ask \u2018How to do it?\u2019  I wrote a letter to the UK Home Office asking them to let the Nepalese equivalent understand that I did not accept that dilatoriness of the Nepalese government in answering my request was reason enough for canceling my original renunciation and asking for my passport back before cancelling it for a second time (only very seldom, if ever, allowed).  I sent the letter by registered Nepalese mail and had several photocopies of my original letter made with a photo of the post office receipt on the top of the page.  Never did answer ensue: I also sent a copy to the British consul here in Nepal \u2013 no response from there either.\n\tLater still Buddhiman and a minister, whom, some thirty years earlier as a schoolboy I had made laugh, went and saw the functionary who would put the \u2018chop\u2019 on my citizenship papers.  Positive.  Hooray!  Buddhiman and a lawyer fixed with said functionary, by phone, to meet on a certain day which happened to be the day the Maoists left the government and Kathmandu erupted.  Cancel mission.  As one might say, every silver lining has its cloud.  Trying to get any governmental decision in Nepal is as hard as trying to put one's thumb on a blob of quicksilver.\n\tIn 2008 a TV-reporter went to see CDO and, off his own bat, asked him why the slowness for me.  His answer was that the case was being looked into.  The next day the reporter came round and I gave him a half-hour plus interview.  I am always careful in what I say under such circumstances: to try and be clever is unwise.  A week later I learnt that the reporter had once more gone to the CDO\u2019s office and, quite how I know not, got him to ring the relevant section in the Home Ministry and demand a positive result.\n\tYet nothing happened until 2009 when we were rung up at 8 o\u2019clock hours one Friday evening and told to be at the ruling party\u2019s senior member's house at 9 o\u2019clock the following Sunday to be \u2018vetted\u2019 and, if successful, the Home Minister would be ordered to let me talk to him about myseven-year wait.  The senior member asked me why I had not got citizenship to which my answer, as it had been before, was \u2018don\u2019t ask me why I have not got it, ask those who should give it to me why they haven\u2019t.\u2019  I met the Home Minister and found that we both worked in CNAS about a quarter of a century before.  He told me I would hear positively within four to six weeks.  I never did.\n\tHow such a call came is complicated but, in brief, Buddhiman\u2019s cousin, A, had a schoolboy friend, B.  I had given a talk to his school about 18 years before which he remembered.  B was by then a police inspector in the ministry building.  B's friend, C, also a police inspector, had a friend, D, a pleader living in the east of the country, who is a nephew of E, a one-time assistant Prime Minister.  D came to Kathmandu, knowing about me, and told his uncle E, that I was in my eighty-fifth year and needed looking after.  E, knowing that F, the Home Minister, would be out of the country some time in the near future, called us \u2018earliest\u2019.  I told F that I wanted him to chase up my file that my eyes had taken a turn for the worse in the past month (I couldn\u2019t recognise people from ten paces and could only read with difficulty) so to let me have Nepal as my last refuge.\n\tSlow forward to 2011: I had now waited for over nine years for an answer to my request.  I wrote a letter to the Prime Minister which was given him when he visited Pokhara and I was at the same function: I wrote a similar letter to the Deputy Prime Minister, he who two years earlier had called me to Kathmandu. The leader of the Young Communist League reported my case to the senior Maoist leader who said he would take my case up.  I hoped that whatever I wrote in my letters wouldn\u2019t get me accused of committing a malfeasance by sophistry or casuistry.  I had recently learnt that Human Rights, Nepal, had, off its own bat, taken my case up.  It was sobering that ex-Gorkha officers of my old Indian Army battalion, 1/1 GR, had also twice been to the Home Ministry.\n\tMother of ironies, the younger brother of the founder of the Nepalese Communist Party asked me why I was not a citizen.  My answer, in my dotage, could be based on the Gospel according to St Matthew: 22: 21, where, instead of rendering to Caesar Caesar\u2019s and to God God\u2019s, put bumbledom v common sense \u2013 but keeping very quiet about it.  I have none of the three most precious currencies of all politicians: position, preferment and patronage.  Instead, living as I do, I only see the underside of the tapestry of Nepalese life.  What I had already done was to write a letter to a future British ambassador in Kathmandu which Buddhiman would take to the embassy if I died before getting citizenship and in which I asked the ambassador to \u2018take my case\u2019 to the Head of State and say such treatment was not the way to keep good relations between Britain and Nepal.\n\tOn 6 December 2011, the President of Federal and Democratic Nepal visited Pokhara to open a campus that had been operative for 25 years already.  The committee arranging events put me on it with a view to telling the President that it was about time I had Nepalese citizenship, having waited over nine years for an answer.  The day before the opening, two campus stalwarts visited the President and told him, in great detail, about me.  Before he arrived at the campus, the Master of Ceremonies mentioned my name to the assembled hundreds and asked the reporters to publish my case.  In my letter to the President I also copied the letters I had written to the past two Prime Ministers, a Deputy Prime Minister and the Home Minister.  To go any higher would have to be to the stratospheric supranational!  As the President swept out of the hall accompanied by so many people jostling him \u2013 my mind irreverently comparing it to a pack of dogs after a bitch on heat \u2013 I was pulled off my chair, Buddhiman leading me.  The President he stopped in front of me.  \u2018Please accept these flowers,\u2019 I said, giving him a bunch \u2018and this, my humble request,\u2019 and put the envelope in his hands.  I then gave him a short Nepali proverb \u2013 invoking the goddess of success, one might say \u2013 and he took it, smiling.  But this also resulted in nothing: four months later I learnt that the President had given my paperwork to his office secretary who refused to touch it.  I have to admit I felt deflated and asked myself what can one expect from any government that makes its decisions viscerally and not cerebrally?\n\tIn 2012 on a morning walk I passed the Armed Forces Police (AFP) Training College and found out that the next Passing Out Parade was to be on the following Friday and that the Chief Guest was the newish Maoist Prime Minister.  Buddhiman and I, dressed smartly, went to see the AFP Commandant to ask him for an invitation.  After the parade we were called into the presence.  I apologised for taking up his time and told him that we had not met for 28 years.  Sitting next to him out came my story with a large retinue listening in with \u2018pin-drop\u2019 silence.  I got them all laughing.  \u2018I\u2019ll get it fixed, don\u2019t worry,\u2019 said the PM.  No need to say that nothing eventuated.\n\tIn 2013 I had an unexpected visit from a freelance Nepalese journalist about my lack of citizenship: the result? \u2013 nothing in Nepal but headlines in Hong Kong\u2019s South China Morning Post.  Soon after that, talking to one of the Maoist foot soldiers now wearing plain clothes, the subject of my (lack of) citizenship came up.  Saddened, he personally went to the Ministry to help me: on hearing the word \u2018Colonel\u2019 the functionary rubbed finger and thumb together despite the ex-foot soldier telling him how much I had already offered the country.\n\tBeing a permanent resident I was lucky in that I did have crumpled leaves, not thorns, to lie on.  Over the long years without the safety of citizenship, to keep safe I have had to show zeal without fire and intelligence without talent, never to cause an argument nor display any unredeeming vices: \u2018when the pen writes a poem it need not understand the verse and whether the pot be whole or broken, it still stands witness to the work of the potter.\u2019\n\tAnd so at last to 2014: towards the end of August the British Ambassador, his First Secretary and Defence Attach\u00e9 had an audience with the President of Nepal and handed over an official Government of Great Britain letter asking that J P Cross, now in his ninetieth year, be granted Nepalese citizenship \u2018in the spirit of G200\u2019 \u2013 I was only told about it after it had happened and I was in no way responsible for it.  It was entirely at the initiative of the Defence Attach\u00e9, Colonel Sean Harris.  I had thought that, having tried not to be British, the British Ambassador would have nothing to do with me.  But I was wrong.  Colonel Harris read out a report of what I had done for the country and its individuals, including the way I had managed to help alleviate famine, in 1978, by reporting on conditions to the British Ambassador who asked London for help.  When the answer came back in the negative saying that the only help being offered was two RAF Hercules aircraft and 20,000 tons of rice to Cambodia, the Ambassador replied that if Lt Col J P Cross recommended help how could it be refused?  My name, being known, \u2018worked the oracle\u2019 and help was split half and half between Cambodia and Nepal.  Colonel Harris told me that I was then on the cusp of getting Nepalese citizenship.\n\tA few weeks later, Buddhiman and I drove into the ministerial complex, an unbelievably difficult feat for a non-ministerial person.  This was the result of my having sown a seed all of thirty-eogt years earlier.  In brief, the primary school in Buddhiman\u2019s village needed money.  From my \u2018aid\u2019 budget I could afford one lakh rupees but the Nepalese government allowed nothing above ten thousand.  I got over that problem by telling the authorities that nine villagers had given me an IOU for ten thousand rupees each so the lakh was accounted for.  The Headmaster of that time never forgot that and, by 2014 was a secretary in the Statistics Branch of the Home Ministry so, with him, we were able to let us drive into the Ministry without any trouble.  There the Citizenship secretary told me that there should be no trouble in getting citizenship from now onward but\u2026but the \u2018jury\u2019 papers (known as \u2018muchulka\u2019) were missing from my file and without them nothing could move forward.  We were told to get the office copy from the Pokhara CDO\u2019s office but after a four-day search nothing came to light so we started all over again.  This took two sessions, one of four hours\u2019 duration and the other of six.  The police had to check me \u2013 was I suffering from any disease, was I a drunkard or a fornicator, was I a breaker of laws (the only law I have broken is the Law of Averages), was I involved in politics, what did I do in my spare time and other intrusive questions.  Buddhiman answered them: no health problems but a man in his ninetieth year has bad eyes and ears.\n\tThe new papers went to Ministry and shortly afterwards on 13 November we had a phone call, \u2018Come to the Ministry tomorrow\u2019.  This we did, again only with the help of the ex-Head, and at 1 o\u2019clock on 14 November 2014 I became the second-ever Brit to become a Nepalese citizen, after a wait of 32 years, 6 momths and 2 days.  The first, fifty years ago, was to the lady who started the Pokhara leprosarium.  The secretary told me that there were two hundred foreign aspirants waiting for their citizenship.  And the missing muchulka was seen in the file, \u2018misplaced\u2019, while some junior clerk had put all my written requests over the years in a file that lay unopened until after my first visit to the Ministry \u2013 a turpitudinal peccadillo?\n\tOn our return my family was ecstatically vivacious: hugs, garlands, bunches of flowers, a cake with \u2018firework\u2019 candles, the lot.  I was most touched on my first morning walk when, called over by the driver of a water tanker, I was told that the previous driver had contacted him to congratulate me \u2013 from California!  I have been deeply, deeply humbled at the great joy shown by so many Nepalis in-country and from every continent except Latin America: beyond expectation and even imagination.\n\tOne national Nepali-language newspaper published my story on the morrow, with my photo, on the front page, another had most of the front page story plus photo, the leading national English-language had my photo while the local Pokhara newspaper also carried the story and the local FM radio broadcast it.  Talk about \u2018knocking a nail out of sight.\u2019\n\tIf and when the worst happens to my eyes, my long struggle for survival being finally over, I will now be safe with my wonderful Nepalese family: \u2018going native\u2019, then \u2018becoming native\u2019, was a price well worth paying in full whatever others may say behind my back.\n172***\nWhen Diana, Princess of Wales, visited Nepal even the young children I met on my morning walks knew her name and excitedly asked me about her.  The reaction of most adults on news of her death was a shake of the head and mutter something about \u2018violation of decorum\u2019 caused it.\n\tIt was ironic that Mother Theresa should have died around the time of Diana\u2019s funeral.  The former full of substance and light on image, the latter full on image and light of substance.  I have heard Nepalese Brahmans say that Mother Theresa\u2019s work was \u2018against the course of nature\u2019 in that a degraded soul must work its own repentance and salvation without external help.  Do Brahmins think similarly about land mines, I wonder.\n173***\nBy the time I had been thirty years in our house in Pokhara I estimated I had walked the equivalent of more than five years and walked the equivalent of three and a half times round the world at the equator.  Only a few stick in the mind.  Once Buddhiman and I, with our two dogs, we thought we could to cross a river, fordable in the dry season.  As it was a month before the monsoon was due we thought we could still cross it without going round by a long detour.  Locals shook their heads and watched us with clinical detachment as it swept us off our feet and we had to swim, being taken downstream the while.  Our two dogs were swept much farther downstream and took some time to join us.  We were soaking wet but had learnt our lesson!\n\tAnother time when quite far from home by myself I tried to stop a dog that was trying to savage a puppy cowering at my feet for safety.  Instead of the puppy the dog savaged me in ten places.  I had to sit still for twenty-five days and wait another fourteen before I could resume my full morning walks.\n174***\nIn 1988 the plan to close the HQ and recruiting depot in east Nepal became firm.  They were to be removed to Kathmandu and Pokhara respectively.  Its removal would cause great upset with all pensioners as one of the best hospitals in country was run by British military doctors.  I was asked if I would go to the ten Welfare Centres, gather the Old and Bold and explain the whole situation.  I was given a serving soldier and with Buddhiman off we set.\n\tThe weather was the worst I had ever had to walk in.  We were in cloud, mist or rain for twenty-six out of thirty-four days.  It was shortly before dawn on the tenth day the earthquake struck.  The porters had wanted to camp on the bank of one of Nepal's largest, half-mile wide, rivers to catch some breeze but, to their disappointment, Buddhiman overruled them and we went up the bank into a hut.  We were awoken by a loud, grating, stuttering noise and being shaken. Cracks in walls were caused but nothing fell down.  We bolted outside. The river rose many feet and was momentarily hurled off course, so the porters looked shame-faced when reminded of their choice.\n\tFarther to the east the damage was heavy and the pensioners flocked to their nearest Welfare Centre so, apart from international goodwill shown, I met far more folk than I would otherwise have done as they came in to report damage to property and livestock.  I therefore had a much wider audience than expected and could spread my reassuring message that, despite their fears and rumours to the contrary, the British were not abandoning the east.\n\tThe glamour and vainglory of regimental soldiering over the years of four decades had long faded but the magic of camaraderie then formed, dormant for so long, instantly and without hesitation rose to the surface everywhere I went.  At eight welfare centres, in villages or on the way, names and numbers, in the main, sprang to the mind and almost everybody had his own anecdote about the times we had spent together \u2013 some true and flattering, some untrue and flattering, others neither!  Looking at the men's animated faces and shining eyes was like looking into a mirror in reverse: smooth-faced, clean-limbed, upright lads that had been were sometimes scarcely recognised now that they had become shrivelled, wrinkled, toothless and grey-haired or bald.  I, too, after so much time, was one for that large army of \u2018those who fade away\u2019.\n\tBut that aside, it was the reactions of one ill man and one old woman I had gone especially to meet.  The man\u2019s village was a day\u2019s walk off my shortest route and when I got there I was told he was ill .  From behind his house, I called his regimental number, rank and name.  I found him sitting forlornly on a wooden bed in the front of his house, clutching a stool to keep himself upright.  His face was puffy, he coughed and wheezed and was obviously unhappy and ill.\n\t\u2018Never in a thousand years did I think we\u2019d meet again,\u2019 he said.  \u2018I heard you were in the university.  Oh yes, I often asked about you.\u2019  I gently reminded him of our time together in the early 1950s on operations in the jungle in Malaya, especially at one time when he had got lost and gone back on his own.  He thought I\u2019d send him back home \u2018bare-footed\u2019 but instead I gave him a beer for still being alive.  That started him off.  For over an hour he was back in time, reliving old actions, quoting old remarks, even singing an old song as the years rolled back and his illness forgotten.  He clutched a sickle, twisting the handle vigorously as guerrilla after guerrilla was met and despatched.  He needed no prompting.  His family stared at him in wonder and delight.  He also told me that I had not risen higher in rank because senior British officers knew I liked Gurkhas better than I liked my own people and I didn\u2019t \u2018toady\u2019.\n\t\u2018Never did I think we would meet again.  I can now die happy,\u2019 he said as I left and slumped over the stool once more as loneliness and heartache overtook him once again.\n\tThe old lady I called on was the mother of one I had served with in the Gurkha Independent Parachute Company and with whom I had walked the eastern hills twenty-three years before.  I had stayed in his house, she a widow even then, and had met her again seven years later when she had started to go blind.  Her son, pensioned, had gone to Kathmandu several times to try and find me, so I was told, but had failed.  Suddenly dying of a heart attack eighteen months before, his mother was still bereft.\n\tShe was sleeping when I went to see her.  I woke her up.  \u2018Mother, the friend of your son has come to meet you,\u2019 I softly told her.  She bade me sit down beside her and then she poured her heart out, weeping copiously as she did.  I held her hand and muttered soothing words as I did but could not stop the flow.  I then had an idea to take her mind off her sadness.\n\t\u2018Mother, was it in 1957 or 1956 that you made that journey to Kathmandu by yourself?\u2019  That was in the days when it was almost unheard of for a woman to travel singly, nor were there any travel facilities.  She would have to have walked around 400 mountain miles, there and back.\n\t\u2018Neither, it was in 1954 and I took my youngest with me...\u2019\n\tFor ninety minutes the old lady gave me chapter and verse as she retraced all her footsteps, giving me graphic accounts of the hardships of the journey \u2013 how she once went for five days with only water for sustenance, how she was ignored, misled, how folk tried to rob her \u2013 but she had prevailed and been successful, even if her people hardly recognised her when she got back home, months later, so thin and weary was she.  For sheer pluck and guts I have seldom heard such a story and wished I could have made a recording of it.  She did not need any prompting: she sat bolt upright, eyes dry, a clarity in her diction and a hardness in her voice that belied her frail body.  She went on and on and on.\n\tGently I told her it was getting dark and I had to leave.  At that she came back from the past into the present, she slumped and started to weep.  Could I accept her invitation to come again and stay?\n\tNot wishing to disappoint her I gave her as evasive as my conscience allowed me...and left her...for ever.\n*\nYears later I was walking down a track towards our nearest main river.  I took two sticks as the path was steep and narrow in places.  While still in the easier part I suddenly felt dizzy for about ten seconds so planted my two sticks in front of me to keep upright.  I wondered what was in store for me but kept on walking, except I did not go near the difficult parts.  I later realised that I had experienced an earth tremor.  On my way back I asked someone if he had noticed the tremor.  No...but then he grinned sheepishly and said that he had.  \u2018So I took my pulse to see if I was ill,\u2019 he said and we both laughed when I told him what I had thought.  When we had a second quake on an otherwise peaceful Sunday, I was sitting down reading.  My chair shook and I thought it was my dog leaning against it, scratching!  It was 289 'map' miles away.\n175***\nThe people in CNAS hoped that I would keep in contact with them once I had gone to Pokhara so I tried to get a phone.  Buddhiman registered our request and was told he would have to wait up to ten years for one.  A politician friend took me to the Zonal Commissioner, a most powerful man, to see if could \u2018work the oracle\u2019 and, talking softly, they kept me at arm\u2019s length for some minutes.  Yes, I could have a phone if I could get his gardener\u2019s youngest and illiterate son enlisted.  (I had, in fact, already enlisted two of his gardener\u2019s elder sons.)  I gave the Zonal Commission a long, long look, bade my farewell and left.\n\tBuddhiman went to the Telecommunications Office to see if he could buy a phone only to learn that the officer had been rung and forbidden to sell him a phone.\n\tForty months after registering for a telephone we got one but nearly missed out: purely by chance Buddhiman dropped into the telephone place and discovered that anybody who had registered for a telephone and still wanted one had to re-register before a fortnight was out.  So he did and we found ourselves number 48 in the queue when we had been around the 2,300th!  Even so we were not on the list for the phone to be connected and the man in charge, a Brahmin, refused to touch it.  However, Buddhiman discovered that this man was the first cousin to a man who had a life-time binding friendship pact between non-relatives, as a first cousin, with a first cousin of Buddhiman\u2019s first cousin and even that tenuous relationship was enough for the job to be done outside office hours with no extra charge!\n176***\nBeing the Chief Guest of any function is considered an honour.  I have been invited as one on a number of occasions.  One was when our hill village mothers organised a small building for their meetings and Buddhiman and I were invited.  I found myself Chief Guest.  The time to start was advertised as 10 o\u2019clock. and we eventually did start at a quarter past three.  Before it started I was asked to daub the forehead of all the village virgins with red-coloured rice, it being the last day of Dashera.  Only then did I cut the ribbon and make the obligatory speech.  I said that Nepal depended on their hard-working women who had so much work to do that even a twenty-five-hour day would be too short so their having arranged for the building of their mud-mortared stone building with its timbered stringers in it was especially remarkable.  It took me ten minutes short of two hours to climb back up the mountain after that, just getting there in time before it was too dark to see properley.  Buddhiman only came much later \u2013 and at eight o\u2019clock the next morning the drums could still be heard beating.\n\tWithin a week I was Chief Guest once more in Pokhara for a more grand affair: an ordinary fellow had wanted to become a Buddhist lama and was advised to study, virtually by himself the whole time, for 3 years, 3 months, 3 weeks, 3 days, 3 hours, 3 minutes and 3 seconds.  When a man is studying the Buddhist scriptures to achieve enlightenment he only knows that he is successful if, overnight, his top knot sprouts a quarter of an inch.  It took this man over three years for that to happen.  His wife visited him once a day with a meal but they were not allowed to look at each other.  A large crowd, of maybe a thousand \u2018ornerry\u2019 folk with over a hundred monks fetched him from his solitude in a colourful procession, with groups of dancers and long Buddhist horns being carried by acolytes and blown lugubriously, with symbols clashing and masked monks a-swirl, to be f\u00eated in our local community hall.  That took three hours.  I did not go to fetch him as tunnel vision specs in a vast crowd in narrow roads was not my idea of fun.  Five hours after I got there, I was called in front of the packed audience to make a speech.  After a full-blooded introduction of the new monk\u2019s status I said that I had been in Asia for more than sixty-three years and had served in countries ruled by a Christian king, Muslim king, Hindu king and a Buddhist king and nowhere had I seen such religious devotion.  I then congratulated the organisers, saying that their performance was as smooth a duck on the water but no one could see just how hard they were waggling their feet.\n\tOnce I was the Chief Guest at a gathering of more the three hundred Nepalese authors at a Literacy Festival: that meant lighting the ceremonial flame then giving a speech.  I really had no idea what to say, never having come across a group of such eminent people before but I remembered a short story by H H Munro, \u2018Saki\u2019, when a young girl had \u2018cuffed\u2019 it effectively because \u2018Romance at short notice was her forte\u2019.  I ignored all mention of authors and had compared Gurkhas with five \u2018round-eye\u2019 armies and ten Asian armies I had served with.  I forget now what I said but I got some good laughs, my name on the radio and in two newspapers.  Some two months later on a morning walk, the son of a Gurkha Officer who was killed in Burma told me how his chest had swelled with pride at listening to me \u2013 nor did I ever hear any rebukes for not following the script when the occasion was mentioned twenty years later.\n\tPractically all functions have a Chief Guest who has formally to be invited into the central seat on a platform in front of the expectant crowd.  There are three types of functions to which I am invited, religious ones, Hindu and Buddhist only, never Muslim or Christian, sports tournaments, and schools\u2019 parents\u2019 days: I have been invited to all three and all of which need a speech to be delivered \u2013 \u2018now the Colonel saheb will say two or four words,\u2019 is the usual formula and I heave myself off my chair, go to the da\u00efs and start ad libbing.  I normally manage to raise some laughs.  The success or otherwise of the talk is shown in the number of hands offered to be shaken by the others on the da\u00efs on my return.  In fact I am practically always asked to speak at any function to which I am invited, Chief Guest or not.\n\tOn 14 January 2011, however, it was, for me, a \u2018first\u2019: I was asked to be Chief Guest in the Indian Army Pension camp here in Pokhara.  This time it was to start off the Nepal-India Friendship School sports day: I was warned just before dusk the day before.  The invitation said the ceremony started at a quarter past 10 on the morrow.  I walked round to the camp \u2013 we can see it from our house \u2013 and arrived there a tad early.  Once inside, I met a vehicle sent to fetch me and saw consternation on the driver\u2019s face.  Protocol had come undone.  As I was talking to the driver, the Assamese camp doctor, a Major, came up with his wife.  He is a delightful man and our joke is my never asking him \u2018How are you?\u2019 but \u2018How am I?\u2019\n\t\u2018Get in the vehicle, please,\u2019 implored the driver.  Bewildered, because I had arrived already, I did as bidden and was driven about two hundred yards to the CO\u2019s bungalow.  The CO was Lt Col Himanshu Bohora, 6/8 GR, whose grandfather was Subedar Major of 2/2 GR and was tortured to death in Singapore by the Japanese.  His great-grandfather was in 2/2 GR and wounded in 1914 at Neuve Chappelle and his great-great-grandfather was in one of the Afghan wars.\n\tI was bidden to sit in the veranda by his wife and given a cup of coffee.  I was quizzed by the Colonel \u2013 what did the P in J P stand for? \u2013 and then all three of us were driven back to the main Rally Ground, on which all students, from the very young to upper teens, were waiting for us, with the Principal on the platform and the staff ushering the little ones, trying to get them to stand still.  I was told to sit in the centre of the front row of comfortable chairs, with two cushions and, once seated there was a march past, the four houses with their coloured flags, boys in front and girls behind, giving a passable \u2018eyes right\u2019\n\tThe Colonel then rose and gave a speech in impeccable English, giving my background \u2013 that is when the P of J P came in \u2013 my Indian Army service and much else.  I was impressed by his knowledge.  He waved a copy of Jungle Warfare in front of him, not that anyone could tell that my name or face were on the cover.  Although he did not say so as such, anyone like myself in the middle eighties who was in India pre-partition is looked on as a rapidly disappearing member of an endangered species.  In fact, for the many Indian officers who visit Pokhara, I am the first \u2013 and only ever? \u2013 such an oddity they thought they would never meet.\n\tAfter the CO sat down next to me and knowing I would have to speak, I asked him, \u2018English or Nepali?\u2019\n\t\u2018English.  The school\u2019s only language is English,\u2019 he replied, in a slightly shocked tone of voice.\n\tHe then left me to go to his office.  An important matter had to be settled: a 7/8th GR soldier, Naik Bishnu Shrestha, coming on pension had been in a train attacked by over forty Indian robbers.  He charged them single-handed and killed three and wounded seven with his kukri so making the others run away and getting back all the loot they dropped as they escaped.  He was due to be given the highest award the Indian Government can give for such an action on 26 January, Republic Day.  He was also being recalled to extend his service and lot of paperwork was entailed and, as it was a Friday, whatever had to be done needed to be done before the weekend.\n\tThe students then gave a physical training display after which \u2018The Colonel sahib will now say two or four words.\u2019\n\tIt was strange to be the Chief Guest at an Indian-Army-sponsored function; strange to be the only non-Nepali and non-Indian there; and strange to be talking in English to such an audience.  I spoke slowly and distinctly, using simple words.  I said how honoured I was to be there \u2013 and I meant it \u2013 and said that the mind and the body both had to be exercised.  I allowed myself a short Nepali saying: \u2018The King never says a person is poor [enough not to pay taxes], fire never says damp wood never burns and going uphill never allows a fat person any forgiveness.\u2019  (It sounds much better in the original.)  I then stood apart from the da\u00efs so all could see me and said \u2018I am [Nepali] eighty-six.  I have had the suit I am wearing for fifty years and it still fits properly.  That is what I mean by keeping fit.\u2019  I was rewarded by a collective gasp from the others on the platform.\n\tThe Principal then thanked me graciously and the invited guests, only a handful on a working day, went for refreshments.  I spoke with the doctor, who was about to be posted.  The conversation started on the impending bravery award.  The doctor said he had been recommended for a bravery award but \u2018doctors don\u2019t earn them\u2019 had been the answer.  I told him that two of the three British Army Victoria Cross and bar winners were doctors.  He showed his surprise.\n\tSomehow we switched to the first Field Marshal, Sam Manekshaw, and the second Field Marshal, Cariappa.  I told him that I had not met the first one but that, at Ootacamund in December 1971, during the Indo-East Pakistan War, I had been summoned to the house of the Maharaja of Porbandar to meet him.\n\tI divert from the Indian Pension camp and continue with my stay in South India: the day before, newly arrived in Ootacamund I had tried to find accommodation.  At the first port of call two Indian ladies from South Africa were holding forth at the reception desk about the colour bar.  I, as the only European in a bunch of Dravidians, was eyed suspiciously.  \u2018Tell me, mister,\u2019 importuned one of the ladies in her sing-song accent, \u2018why is colour bar?\u2019  I looked at her, wondering how best not to become involved.  \u2018I know where is this Malabar,\u2019 I countered, \u2018but I am not knowing where is this colour bar.\u2019  I abruptly left with my baggage, seeking other accommodation, before my audience could further react.\n\tThis I found at the Savoy Hotel, a European-owned and run institution twenty-five years out of date but still surviving.  The manageress still spoke of Home, read her English newspapers disdainfully, took tea exactly at half past four every afternoon in her office (knees rug-draped to ward off the cold as fuel was so expensive) and fed her fat and pampered Pekinese pet dog on paper-thin jam sandwiches while it was sitting on her lap.\n\tThat first afternoon I called in at the Nilgiri Library.  It was a fascinating place.  Except for a few recent daily papers, it was a monument to 1947; nothing had changed, so it seemed.  I was allowed into a smaller room, where the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (1929 edition) was kept.  Here, sternly staring from a frame on the opposite wall, was a painting of the Queen Empress, presented to the library on the occasion of her Golden Jubilee in 1887.  All else was much older.  Dust was the only post-independence addition to the old magazines and periodicals: Nineteenth Century from 1878, Frazers Magazine from 1864, with Bailey\u2019s and Badminton equally old.  Tantalisingly, Blackwoods started with volume 2, dated 1817, and continued intact until 1915.  What farthest ripple of the Great War lapped into that bleak room, putting an end to a ninety-eight-year collection?\n\tI saw what I thought was a man\u2019s name, Neil Gherey, but I learnt it was the old Anglo-Indian spelling of Nilgiri, \u2018Blue Hills\u2019.  I was also told that Ootacamund was the bastardised version of the local aboriginal Toda \u2018Otha-ka-mand\u2019, the Village of the One Big Stone.  Victoriana spoke of the place as \u2018Snooty Ooty\u2019.\n\tMy musings were interrupted by the secretary introducing himself, an ex-Major Son Dutt.  Urbane, impeccable English and friendly, here indeed was a living link with the past.  More links were made manifest when, next evening, I was called to the telephone by a staccato and addressed by a dictatorial voice (which failed to identify itself) asking me my business and inviting me to breakfast on the morrow with the Maharaja of Porbandar.  The latter then came to the telephone when the invitation was repeated and, mystery settled, General Cariappa would also be there.  It was the General who had heard from Major Son Dutt that a British Army officer was in Ooty.  The General, the first Commander-in-Chief after the British left India, had retired some years before.  He was in Ooty giving a lecture to the Indian Union Club Cultural Centre on \u2018Mother India\u2019.\n\tBreakfast the next morning was good.  The General and I had fruit, porridge and cream, \u2018rumble-tumble\u2019 scrambled eggs, followed by toast, butter and the Maharani\u2019s home-made marmalade.  However, it was fasting day for the Maharaja, who nibbled a raw carrot, and for the Maharani, who toyed with a banana.  The General monopolised the conversation.  He suggested to the Maharani, who was the secretary of the Indian Union Club Cultural Centre, that I give them a talk.  I demurred, pleading a clash of dates.  The proposed lecture was then brought forward to a Thursday (\u2018the first time in our Club\u2019s history\u2019) and I was obliged to name my subject.  I chose \u2018South-East Asia \u2013 Historic and Prophetic\u2019.  Thus it was that many little notices appeared all over Ooty during the next few days, advertising this supposed attraction.\n\tSoon after this the party dispersed.  The General drove down into the Plains, escorted for the first few miles by the Maharaja and Maharani, who showed him a short cut through the town.  There farewells were said.  I accompanied the General some distance in his car before returning to Ooty by a previously ordered taxi.  \u2018What wonderful English the Maharani speaks,\u2019 I ventured.  \u2018Should do,\u2019 he said, \u2018she\u2019s a Welsh woman.\u2019  I learnt that the Maharaja had captained the first Indian cricket Test XI to England in 1932 as well as being an international squash player, an author, an artist and a composer.  Talented and positive, the ex-ruler was one of the Old School.\n\tAnd now back to Pokhara I turned to the doctor and said, \u2018Doctor sahib, you will be the only serving officer in the Indian Army who will know what I am about to tell you about Field Marshal Cariappa.  On our way down into the plains, the General, not a Field Marshal then, opened up.  He, a stickler for time, told me how he had once thought he was late for the function he was driving himself to.  Just as he came to a level-crossing the barrier was dropped.  Passage barred.  \u201cI called the gate keeper over and said to him in the local language \u2018Please lift the barrier.  The train won\u2019t be here for five minutes.  Please let me through.\u201d  \u201c\u2018No\u2019\u201d, came the answer, so I waited impatiently.  As soon as the barrier was lifted, I sped through and, five miles farther on, the same thing happened.  The barrier to another level crossing came down just I arrived.  Again I pleaded in the local language but the answer was the same.  \u201c\u2018No.\u2019\u201d  I glanced at my watch.  I was worried.  When the train had passed up went the barrier and through I dashed.  Colonel sahib, you will not believe me when I tell you a few miles farther on another barrier came down just as I arrived.\u201d\n\t\u2018Although he was driving down a winding road, he looked round at me.  \u201cThis time I called out to the keeper in English: \u201c\u2018Open the bar, you bloody fool.  What the devil do you think you\u2019re doing?\u2019\u201d and open it he did.  I slipped through and arrived just in time.  That\u2019s the way to get around.\u2019\u201c\n\t\u2018Doctor sahib, I marvelled.\u2019\n\tThe General went on.  \u201cOne has to have discipline.  My daughter was married to a Captain.  That first evening, after the party, I told the new bridegroom, \u201c\u2018Breakfast is at 8 o\u2019clock.  Be punctual.\u2019\u201d  He came down at 20 past.  I was angry.  I said, \u201c\u2018after breakfast you will go back to your battalion and have a week\u2019s extra Orderly Officer and only then can you go on your honeymoon.\u2019\u201d\u2019\n\tBy that time the Doctor\u2019s, the other guests; and the assemble ladies\u2019 eyes were button bright.\n\t\u2018And another point I\u2019d like you to know \u2013 and I guarantee no one in the Indian Army knows this,\u2019 I continued, bit between the teeth.  \u2018In 1936 or 1937, at Alexandra Post, on the North-West Frontier and at 8200 feet high the highest fortified position in India, , Captain Cariappa handed over to Captain Vaughan, the first CO of the British Army 1/7 GR.  Vaughan [the men pronounced his name \u2018Bhagwan\u2019] told Cariappa to open a sealed box of 2-inch mortar ammunition.  Cariappa cavilled: \u201cit is sealed,\u201d he said.  \u201cYou have signed for a full box of 2-in mortar ammunition.  I want to count them,\u201d said Vaughan, so he opened it and, horror of horrors, it was full of sand.  A court-martial offence if ever there was one, especially on the Frontier.\u2019\n\tThe excitement in my listeners was obvious.\n\t\u2018The paperwork made its way to the Highest Authority.  Everybody expected a court-martial but, to everybody\u2019s amazement, nothing happened.\u2019\n\t\u2018Why not?\u2019 asked the Doctor.\n\t\u2018Because,\u2019 I said, \u2018even as long before independence as that, British officers knew that the post-independence army would need good officers.  It was obviously a mistake and he was given the benefit of the doubt.\u2019\n\tAnd heads shook in wonder, smiles appeared on all faces and a different view of pre-independence British India made heads shake in appreciation.\n\tTime to leave.  I said my farewells and, although prepared to walk back, I was taken by vehicle.\n\tAll in all, it was a different ending to an unusual Chief Guest day.\n\tI wrote both to the Principal of the school and the Colonel on the morrow.  In the latter\u2019s letter I put that I had missed the Indian Independence Medal by two minutes.  My disappointment had now been fully obviated by such a wonderful and happy occasion.  And why not?\n177***\nA five-star hotel complex, complete with a 9-hole golf course, was built some way out of Pokhara. Just to its south is the flight path of planes, mainly with tourists, many of whom had booked into this hotel.  Near the hotel, the army started a training camp where mortars were fired \u2013 into in the flight path!  A committee got together and complained to the CDO who was unable or unwilling to change it; and to the Prime Minister who was of like mind.  So a delegation decided to lay a petition in front of the Chief of Army Staff.  They went to Kathmandu and after a week\u2019s futile waiting for an answer to their request to see him, they decided to stop his car as it left his residence, petition ready in an envelope.  The car did not stop so the delegation followed it.  The car was stopped by a traffic light with the delegation\u2019s car just behind, so the leader, showing remarkable promptitude, got out and, beckoning the inmate to open the window, handed the petition to the surprised Chief.  So that was that!  But what did the delegation expect?  Nothing and that is what they got.  Six months later Buddhiman and I were on our morning walk and we heard mortar fire from that same training area.  While we were watching fourteen bombs were fired and three planes flew past, descending for their final approach into Pokhara.  I noticed one plane fly slightly off the normal path, to the north, and the two others similarly to the south.  Only years later did the mortars stop firing when planes were in the area.\n178***\nOn one visit Buddhiman made to his mountain village he told me of a strange phenomenon: one night at around 2 o\u2019clock, he with five others saw what looked like a night-time rainbow, on the ground, drifting slowly and the size of a large blanket although circular in shape.  At first it was thought to be a ghost but Buddhiman told them no, it was not a ghost but a \u2018snake jewel\u2019, nag mani, something mysterious that only manifests itself at night.  One of the people who saw it shone a torch at it and it disappeared, only to shine once more when the torch was turned off. They went over to see if they could get to the bottom of such an unusual incident but there was nothing to be seen when they got to the site which was across a small and narrow glen.\n\tI wondered what the natural reason for such a phenomenon could be. Not so very far away is a sharp rock on a hill ridge that suddenly appeared unaided only a few generations back. It stands about six feet above the rest of the ground.  It is thought to be something holy and a small temple has been erected there.  However, geologically the Himalayan massif is in flux, in that India is moving north at an inch a year, while north of the Himalayas is not moving at all.  In other words, the south is \u2018squeezing\u2019 the Himalayas, year by year, until something drastic happens.  It is not surprising that bits of rocks stick up through ridges but that doesn\u2019t explain the round rainbow at night at ground level.  I then remembered the name of the region in which this took place means \u2018sulphur\u2019.  In other parts of the region are hot springs; why can\u2019t other pressures \u2018burp up\u2019 from underground though some crevice in the form of a small sulphurous cloud a person can see in the residual star light of an otherwise dark night, show for a few glistening moments before evaporating and causing a ghostly impression?\n179***\nWhen I took Buddhiman and Bhimkumari to England, her first time, she wanted to know why a beggar was wearing jewellery, it being a Flag Day woman with her collecting box, and scolded her husband for telling her that English husbands treated their wives with more consideration than did Nepalese husbands treat theirs when that just was not the case.  When Buddhiman asked her why her answer was that the husbands never gave their wives enough money to buy enough cloth to cover their legs.\n180***\nAnd an occurrence that had never happened to me before, but had once to Buddhiman, my name being the last words uttered by a dying man.  I had been asked to go to his house, not knowing how ill he was and there just was not time to go when we got the message to come and see him.  When we got to the man\u2019s house on the morrow we were upbraided for not having come the day before as he had so badly wanted to talk to me.  I felt stupefied and unworthy in the extreme when I was told that by his family.  Savagely and sadly strange to say, I could not put a face to the man\u2019s name when i was told it.  I apologised deeply and sincerely to the dead man\u2019s unsmiling family members and left the house deeply ashamed at my bad memory.\n181***\nWhen I went to the local bazaar I used to make a point of stopping by an ex-Indian Army soldier who had been paralysed from his waist down since being involved in a bad motor accident twenty-four years previously.  I once asked him if he still had any feeling in his lower limbs.  He said he felt nothing at all and, in the mornings on waking, if he could see blood on his toes, he knew that rats had nibbled him when he was sleeping.  If he had not seen the blood he would not have known he had been eaten alive.  I should have asked him why he didn't keep cats but some of the rats are so big normal sized cats do not deter them.  This man drew a disability pension. But what a dreary life he had to lead.  I never heard him grumble\n182***\nNepalis say one never knows what Providence will decide.  One day Providence decided to smile on me thrice.  I went to the dentist who filled a tooth for free; on the way back the taxi driver purposely undercharged me because it was up to him to help a father figure who made them laugh when broadcasting on the local radio; and later that day a small girl rushed at me, waving a paper bag full of toffees and said that I had to take one.\nThen there was the shy lass, of about ten years of age, who stopped me in the street: \u2018Grandfather, Grandfather, I can wobble my ears like you do.  Look.\u2019  And wobble them she did!\n183***\nOne day, without any warning, a man came into the house to sing a song in thanks for a joke I had told him fifty-one years before.  Is Nepal the only country such a phenomenon can occur?\n184***\nThe perils of senescence, eyes and ears: I had driven to over to the east for a conference and, on the way back, we had permission to use a feeder road that was being made, cutting many miles off our journey.  Our permit had to be surrendered halfway yet, at the end of the road, we were not allowed forward without producing the same permit.  I remonstrated but to no avail.  It was still chilly and the man who was stopping us, a thin creature, was dressed in a green jersey.  I suggested that we go to see his boss in the office, a furlong away, on the main road.  He agreed to this and he moved ahead quickly.  I soon lost sight of him.  I could not read the sign boards so was unable to tell which office was which but, luckily, I did find the man.  He had not gone to the office; he was sitting, sunning himself.  He looked fatter than before and he was opening his coat, so I thought, to get the sun to his belly.  I called to him and angrily asked what he was doing, only to be greeted with giggles from the people near me.  I was talking to a green rain tub.\n\tBack home I left the house on my morning walk at dawn and saw a bent man in front of me, wearing a white coat and walking slowly, using two walking sticks.  Worse than I am, poor old man I callously thought, haven\u2019t seen him around before.  I called out to him and got no answer.  I caught him up and to my dismay found I\u2019d been calling a cow.\n\tOn another walk I was momentarily stopped on a narrow track just before a main road on a morning walk by the most ferocious growling of a not very large dog.  I thought to myself, \u2018a-ha, my ears are not all that deaf after all,\u2019 but realised how I wrong I was \u2013 and \u2018tricked\u2019 by my tunnel vision \u2013 when I saw that a motorbike on the road to one side of me was revving its engine as it started up.\n185***\nGreat excitement was generated when a group of leather workers who lived near Buddhiman's village went fishing in the small river at the bottom of the mountain just before it flows into the main river.  One of them saw a stone that glistened.  He went over to it, picked it up and an incandescent glow covered his hand and spread up his arm.  A man next to him, hardly believing his eyes, took it out of his hand and, as he was holding it, was scared stiff as he saw his hand and arm become a twinkling golden colour.  \u2018It\u2019s a ghost, an evil spirit,\u2019 he shrieked and threw it away as far as he could.  Much consternation ensued at such an unlucky find which was later diagnosed as a paras, a Philosopher's stone, as rare a find as anyone can expect \u2013 or nearly so: Buddhiman\u2019s brother-in-law\u2019s grandfather (work that one out!) found a stone that was the size of a football that similarly glistened.  He took it as a god and carried it home where it lit up the darkness of the hill house that has no windows.  He called his wife to look at it: she cursed him for bringing such an unnatural object into the house and threw it away.  It smashed into minute pieces, none of which were ever picked up again.\n\tIt was uranium in both cases.  Apparently there is a mountain of the stuff in northwest Nepal that is said to last the world for a century.\n186***\nThe BBC weather people would be intrigued at the way some particularly heavy and unseasonable rain and hail during a supposedly dry part of the year was explained: a young female Nihilist, and a Brahman to boot, had wanted to show her contempt for traditional female- and male-dominated divisions of labour by taking a yoke of oxen and doing the ploughing.  That act of defiance has been, so all and sundry said, the cause of the heavy rain.  A little later a group of four women Brahmans went ploughing and caused the worst hail storm in living memory with lumps of the stuff lying around for two days: cause and effect?\n\tA year later well into in the dry season saw extremely heavy storms.  All was opposite from normal. I was told why by one hill man: girls were wearing trousers and boys grew their hair down their backs.  As stupid as a Brahman blaming the Government for bad weather.  He just would not believe me when I corrected him.\n187***\nRice does not grow above seven and a half thousand feet but maize does.  Maize has been in South and Central America for six to seven thousand years.  Maize eaters tend to be short, scrawny and have cavities in their teeth.  Untreated maize retains its B vitamins, particularly its niacin.  Eat too much and you will end up with pellagra, which includes mental impairment.  Is that a clue to some of the unexplained mental \u2018thickness\u2019 found in some Nepalis from very high up in the mountains? \u2013 or even the more slower-than-usual performance of buffaloes which had had a surplus of it?\n188***\nDuring the rice harvest one year it rained heavily one morning so I opened my brolly before stepping forth on my walk.  After it had stopped raining I kept the brolly open to dry it but was shouted at by many people to fold it up.  In my ignorance I did not k now that in November anyone walking under a brolly when it is not raining will bring on hail.  And, believe it or not, it did hail that very evening.\n189***\nLife, certainly for me here, has its surprises.  On one morning walk a Brahman, a radio producer of a weekly Hindu religious programme told me he wanted me to talk about life.  The programme went out every Tuesday morning from 5 to 6 o\u2019clock.  I only spoke for half an hour.  Not knowing what questions I'd be asked made me wonder if I could \u2018react to the unexpected\u2019 properly.  Writing this years later I have forgotten what I said but I can remember wondering how many folk would tune in at that time of day.  I found out on subsequent morning walks and was satisfied to learn that what I'd said was approved of by the many, far more than I would have expected, who told me they had listened in.\n*\nIt might not be out of place here to mention another radio occasion: sometime in 1984 I was approached by a \u201960 Minutes\u2019 (I think that is the name I was given) and asked many questions, one of which was I a \u2018Victoria Cross\u2019 holder.  I said no, I was John Cross and to be Victoria Cross I\u2019d need a sex change.  A sharp \u2018cut\u2019 interrupted me and my interviewers packed up and left.  I never did hear if any of my talk was broadcast or not.  I rather doubt it.\n190***\nBuddhiman took me up to our mountain home in his vehicle and we had three punctures on our way back.  Buddhiman was not surprised as he had seen three bad omens on the way up: crippled man \u2018crabbing\u2019 in the middle of the road moving off to the right and two mongooses, both moving left to right.  At the second puncture, miles from anywhere, I stupidly said \u2018thank goodness it is light and not raining!\u2019  Our third happened in the dark and in the middle of a thunder storm.  We got back home eight hours late.\n191***\nI\u2019m not one for celebrating birthdays as the older I get the change in the total of years spent on earth are a grim reminder of the few remaining ones.  However, there come times when one just cannot refuse and when that happened to me the day before my birthday the local Basketball Association Secretary rang through and said that I was needed at a certain pitch at half past 7 on the morrow.  Buddhiman and I got there and two teams were lined up: apparently that day was Olympics Day also and the local sponsor had raised two senior teams.  I was introduced to all, including the referee but before any warm up started a table and chair were brought onto the pitch.  A long cardboard box followed and, when undone, revealed a large birthday cake.  I had to sit down and cut the first slice to accompaniments of sparklers and \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 from all present.  Then a most beautiful girl came and, having cut another slice, fed me to the greatest applause.  The table and chair were taken away and as the game began the cake was distributed to all spectators.  A most unusual birthday present.\n192***\nThe reputation of the Brigade of Gurkhas in the British Army \u2013 and the Gorkha Brigade in the Indian Army \u2013 is formidable.  Men of both have something special compared with most other military men in other armies.  Both are almost entirely made up of \u2018epicanthically eye-lidded Mongoloid men, originally in trans-Himalaya, where B\u00f6n shamanism reigned supreme and who then settled into a Cis-Himalayan society, where Hindu jogis also have significant influence\u2019: the Nepali hill men we know by the English word \u2018Gurkha\u2019 and who have been our comrades-in-arms since 1815.\n\tI maintain that our men\u2019s \u2018something special\u2019 is their \u2018putting more into what they do for longer than do most other troops\u2019, certainly before they are passed over for promotion, and to such an extent that their high standard has brought its own penalties of expectation.  Gurkhas are a mystery to many and it is fair to ask if our men give substance to that mystery or mystery to the substance?  Whichever way, there is an untapped residue of resilience that manifests itself in ways unusual and often unexpected.\n\tTrans-Himalayan life was indeed the survival of the fittest when \u2018something extra\u2019 was needed.  Cis-Himalayan life, coming into contact with the Laws of Manu, the 2500-year old \u2018bible\u2019 for caste that slowly moved north from India, put men born in the foothills of the Himalayas, the men we mostly enlist in the Brigade, as of the lowest caste but whose touch does not contaminate water.  (This classification was slightly elevated by a \u2018durbar\u2019 edict some sometime in the Nineteenth Century.)  Our men are much nearer the shaman than they are to the jogi \u2013 but both impinge on them.  Hindu \u2018inferiority\u2019 of caste now vies with B\u00f6n, and Buddhist, shamanic influence.  The latter gives them inner strength while the former means they have to do more than others for their potential to be recognised, certainly in Nepal, thus creating a subcutaneous \u2018dis-ease\u2019.  Consequently the \u2018inner self\u2019 often needs added inner fortitude to compete with their soi-disant superiors to redress the outer imbalance.  Life in a street-wise, part-secular, part-Christian army among many non-believers of another nation gives previously inexperienced challenges and brings this impetus for \u2018something extra\u2019 even more to the fore: an ever-present triangular paradigm.  And how well have our men managed!\n\tQuite how have they managed?  Expressed differently, I believe it is because our men \u2013 and other Asians \u2013 have retained a strong \u2018Mystical Dimension\u2019 or \u2018Magic of the Inner Self\u2019, where \u2018mystical\u2019 describes an altered state of consciousness and \u2018magic\u2019 means \u2018the energy of the unseen\u2019.  Neither of which phenomena will our men find indigenously during their service in Britain where both are normally met with undisguised scepticism if not disbelief but both phenomena can cure, curse or even curb one\u2019s activities \u2013 God\u2019s Law and Dame Luck or Sod\u2019s Law and Lame Duck?\n\tThinking about such matters has lent credence for a hypothesis, not original but strangely comforting, that both shaman and jogi, whose ability to assume an altered state of consciousness plays such a potent part in our men\u2019s cultural upbringing, \u2018their collective unconscious\u2019 almost, are an influence upon our men to an extent that probably they, and assuredly we, do not fully realise, and result in a greater initial culture shock of life in England than many may have supposed.\n\tTo develop this hypothesis: I have found only very few people who can enter an altered state of consciousness, a self-trance, with time-honoured herbal drugs, where \u2018normal\u2019 matters are subsumed by \u2018abnormal\u2019 ones and such a person\u2019s soul becomes untethered.  This process is at least 30,000 years old and is shown in upper pal\u00e6olithic cave paintings, which, according to those who have studied them, are the start of religion and art.  Similarly African Bushmen, Australian aborigines, the Mayan and Aztec civilizations in South America are included in similar practices.  Such \u2018out of consciousness\u2019 is also said to explain ghosts, angels and djinn and, in medi\u00e6val Europe, a belief in fairies, witches, elves (the \u2018sinner elf\u2019), pixies and changelings to say nothing of countless equivalents in every other society the world over.\n\tIf this hypothesis is accepted it can explain Christian miracles, healing, \u2018raising from the dead\u2019, the epiphany and other activities not up to normal mortals.  Likewise other seemingly implausible activities include \u2018chariots of fire ascending into heaven\u2019 and the Muslim belief that ten animals have been admitted into paradise.\n\tBesides modern drugs that get people \u2018stoned\u2019, a heightened awareness caused by fear, when adrenaline rushes into the blood, falling in love, being hypnotised, being drunk or beside oneself with rage, severe hunger and thirst, brain damage or plain madness cause molecular changes in the brain so alters the state of consciousness.\n\tIn England one merely \u2018gets out of the wrong side of bed\u2019: our Gurkhas\u2019 \u2018sinner elf is being troublesome\u2019.\n\tJust some examples from my own experience of what can happen when an altered state of consciousness and untethered souls impinge, not only on our men but others in Asia:\nA retired Gurkha officer, let us call him Himan, had three sons.  His eldest son was still unmarried at forty and lived and worked in England as a film director.  He contracted bone cancer but did not tell his father and step-mother and died soon after.  I went to commiserate with the father and what I was told was surprising.  His wife had died twenty years previously, his middle son ten years after that: a pilot in Royal Nepal Airlines, he had been ordered to fly an overweight aircraft and had had a fatal accident.  Now, another ten years on his eldest son had died.  Though a Buddhist, so not believing in Hinduism, Himan was inveigled by the man who would have been the dead pilot's father-in-law to consult a medium, a Hindu grandmother, in Kathmandu.  She and her husband were total strangers to Himan.  He went.  He was told to sit still while she went into a trance and her husband took notes of what the 'goddess' being invoked said through the medium.  She knew his entire life history, even to his inner thoughts.  Because he had never worshipped the goddess that was talking to him through the medium, she was punishing him once every ten years until he did and unless her instructions on what sacrifices he had to make to her, the goddess, were followed, in another ten years his youngest son would also die.  He had to make live animal sacrifices and he was told what sort these had to be.\n\tHiman remonstrated, saying that he had never, nor would he ever, make blood sacrifices as he was a Buddhist who does not take life, not a Hindu, who does.  The answer to that was that the difference in the religion was so little that he would have to make a blood sacrifice or its equivalent, which is to cut a pumpkin in half instead.  And a whole lot more.  He remained a very troubled and sad old man until he lost his mind shortly before dying:\nBefore Dashera 1955 A and D Companies, 1/7 GR, were co-located at a small village in Negri Sembilan, named Simpang Pertang.  A police jungle company had an adjacent compound.  One night all the soldiers in one room were woken up when a hand pulled open the mosquito net, groped and, finding the end of the sleeper\u2019s member, pinched it.  No person was seen but one man was suspected.  A report next morning resulted in a sentry standing over the suspected man\u2019s bed all night.\n\tThe man never arose but every man\u2019s member was once again pinched.\n\tConsternation and suspicion, in equal amounts, ensued.\n\tThe same thing happened the next night.  The Company 2 IC then ordered kukris to be stacked in the guardroom.  This was done.\n\tThe next day most of the company went the fifty miles over the mountains to Battalion HQ for \u2018mar\u2019.  I went ahead in my private car and was disturbed when the convoy was late.  When it arrived I was told that one vehicle had overturned squashing dead the man suspected of outraging the other soldiers\u2019 innate modesty.\n\tI was called away to the phone to talk to an incensed European Police Lieutenant in Simpang Pertang.  Last night one of my soldiers had climbed into bed with a policeman and his wife and had insisted in snuggling up between the married couple.\n\tI apologised and told him that I could do nothing about it as the man was dead;\n\tIn 1959 a signalman on duty in the \u2018comcen\u2019 of 17 Gurkha Division in Rasah Camp, Seremban, left his desk, wandered out, over the camp entrance road and stepped into the \u2018lalang\u2019, the long grass on the other side.  He urinated and felt a red-hot pain enter him.  He staggered back to the \u2018comcen\u2019 where the Sergeant in charge took one look at him, did not understand what he was trying to say so took him back to the Gurkha Signals camp, a few miles off, at Sikamat, and told him to go to bed.  The Sergeant told the Gurkha Major.\n\t\u2018Let him sleep it off and I will see him when he awakes,\u2019 was the verdict.\n\tWhen the man awoke he did not understand what was said to him and only answered in Chinese, of which he had no previous knowledge.\n\tA Chinese shaman from the bazaar was sent for.  He came to the camp, talked with the Gurkha in Chinese, not the normal bazaar Malay, and was understood.  He was taken to see where the stricken signalman had urinated and gave his verdict.  During the Japanese occupation, inmates of a local hospital had been driven out and massacred where now the lalang grew and no obsequies had been performed.  The signalman had to be exorcised.  This he would do, bringing him half way back, and that had to be followed by a Gurkha jha\u00f1kri to bring him the other half.\n\tThis was done and the man fell asleep.\n\tNext morning he was as he had ever been, speaking his own language and not understanding any Chinese.\n\tAs a rider, the history of 4 GR notes that pre-war on the North-West Frontier, during a ten-minute halt, a rifleman had wandered off and had happened to urinate on a Muslim grave.  The same had happened to him: he was \u2018cured\u2019 by the regimental medical officer, a Muslim;\n\tWhen I and nine Gurkhas were operating the Malay-Thai border and hungry, we became weak.  After three weeks, when we were hiding up as our three-man aboriginal escort, local Temiars, went probing for news, it took me five days to learn the Temiar language well enough to debrief them on their return.\n\tEventually we made camp on the only flat piece of ground near an aboriginal settlement.  The rest of my company flew in and one platoon went downstream where a soldier was drowned.  I was ordered to go and investigate.  I went with one Temiar, did what I had to do, and, painfully slowly, returned.\n\t\u2018I am going to wash in the river,\u2019 I told my men.\n\tI went down and stood on a round stone two paces in the water some twenty yards from a waterfall.  I had soaped myself and was just about to scoop up some water when I heard maniacal laughter.  I looked round, fearing terrorists, and was pushed hard enough to lose my balance and was swept away.  I got to the edge of the river five yards from the lip of the waterfall.\n\tI went back and continued my ablutions.  Again maniacal laughter, a harder push and I got out of the water just before being swept over the waterfall.\n\tBut no terrorists.\n\tI dried myself and angrily presumed it was my men \u2018having fun\u2019.  I upbraided them on my return to be met with blank astonishment at my accusation.\n\tWe only then learnt that we were camping on an aboriginal graveyard so what did we expect?\n\tWe were all haunted: at night my hammock was shaken drastically; one man was pushed off a bench we had made with no one near enough to touch him; the candles we had with us, were doused with no wind.\n\tNo obsequies had been performed on the dead men as normally the Temiar moved their dwellings on the death of one of their people.  The government had not allowed them to move.  None of them dared come to us by night, only by day.\n\tWe were relieved by men from another company and resolved not to tell them that we were living in a graveyard \u2013 but the morning after their first night, they knew although none was hungry or tired enough to be \u2018molested\u2019.\n\tI could mention many more such instances but even these few may show that my hypotheses cannot be completely ignored and a \u2018sinner elf\u2019 may, in one guise of another, be just around the corner\u2026\n\n193***\nI had a book sent to me by registered post from south India and was told about it by e-mail.  After a month I went to the Pokhara post office and asked if an inquiry could be made as, by then, the package should have arrived.  Not allowed, I was told.  I then asked the sender in India to check and see if it ever left India.  Yes, it had and had arrived in Kathmandu two days later.  The package reached Pokhara six months to the day later.\n194***\n\u2018Habits up in the village take a long time to change,\u2019 Buddhiman told me.  \u2018Time is slower there than elsewhere, I sometimes think.\u2019\n\tI was well aware of the Nepali characteristic of an elephantine memory.  Times without number have I been reminded of events of more than a score of years earlier being brought out as though they had happened \u2018just the other day\u2019.  We had been talking about the situation as it was developing here in Nepal in March 1994, with rumours about a vote of no confidence in the prime minister.\n\t\u2018There have always been bouts of political turbulence of one sort or another, especially in Kathmandu, but locally also.  I can so well remember talking about one particular incident that I had just heard about.  I was about ten years old.\u2019  That would put the date at around 1958.  I knew his village was Thuloswara, in western Lamjung, not far from the border with Kaski.  It is a large place covering the side of a mountain.  A quick walker, travelling light and starting very early, can reach the snow line of the inner Himalayan range within the day.\n\t\u2018I had just heard of some trouble between us and another tribe from the north.  That night I asked my father if he could tell me more about it.  Before he had time to open his mouth \u2013 well, he had opened it but he had a stutter \u2013 before he had time to say anything mother bade me keep quiet.  \u2018You must never talk about those times, son.  It is dangerous to gossip.  Many of our menfolk spend too much time gossiping.  You never know when those who shouldn\u2019t hear will hear and get angry again.\u2019  So I kept quiet but I will tell you what I know.  It had happened some time before...\u2019\n\tMy mind went back to the troubles in the early 1950s when the Rana regime had been toppled and the Shah dynasty, virtually eclipsed since the Kot Massacre of 1846, came into its own again, as it had since Nepal was unified under King Prithvi Narayan Shah, in 1768.  In fact, the Shah dynasty can be dated from 1559 when Gorkha was captured by Drabya Shah.  From 1949 to 1951 I had been instructing in the Army School of Education (Gurkha) in Singapore and, during the troubles, students recently returned from their home leave in the east told me of an Indian-domiciled Nepali congressman, Deoprakash Rai, leading an armed band from Darjeeling into Nepal as far as Ilam.  This man had been a Colour Sergeant instructor under me and I had temporarily to take over his Nepali teaching practices when he left us in a hurry s \u2013 sedition, attempted conspiracy with the Communist enemy and attempted mutiny.  He had died, a campus folk hero, not long before I joined the staff of the university in Kathmandu in 1982.\n\tIn 1967, when on trek in the east of Nepal I was shown bullet holes in houses that had been shot up fifteen or so years before.  There had been many such shootings in other parts of the country which I only heard about later.  The army of Nepal was busily engaged and, in 1994, I found one old soldier who took part against the agitators and who still remembers it all very vividly.\n\tThe story continued: \u2018Our people were being harassed from the north and, in desperation, they sent a delegation to the strongest family in Syangja to help them.\u2019\n\tI understood that both parties to the unrest were hill men, strongly represented in the Indian and British Armies as 'traditional martial classes'.\n\t\u2018From Syangja town?\u2019 I queried.\n\t\u2018No, from Nawakot, the old defensive fort just over the Kaski-Syangja border.\u2019\n\tThat puzzled me until I remembered that clandestine groups worked away from administrative centres \u2013 Trisuli used to be the base for dissatisfied elements from Kathmandu.\n\t\u2018How long it took to persuade the head of family, Kulamandan Shah, for help is uncertain.  Eventually his grown-up second boy, called Kalu, went back with the delegation as the communit's leader.  I expect he was accompanied by a wife, servants, if not retainers, as were all important people in feudal days.\u2019\n\tThe son having a different caste from his father puzzled me.  I had enlisted Khans and Sahis myself, but not Shahs.  Also all periods of the Rana regime were known as \u2018feudal\u2019 but I had not realised that part of the Shah family still lived around Syangja.  Not wishing to show my ignorance, I kept quiet.\n\u2018Up at the top end of our village is a large stone, called the Sindur\u00e9 dhu\u00f1ga, which had been used in past times for kings to be crowned.  That was during the period of the 22 Raj and the 24 Raj.  Lamjung was then a separate entity.  This is where Kalu was officially recognised as the paramount person in the district.\n\t\u2018Six months after he got there, he went north, up the Marsyangdi river, to liaise with the folk upstream but they ambushed him and his two companions.  They were tied to trees, shot and killed by a man called Banjhar\u00e9.\u2019\n\tBanjhar\u00e9 was a name I had not come across before.  As far as such violence was concerned, I remembered the first British visitor in that area telling me that when he was there, in 1950s, he was threatened by people carrying firearms.  I mentioned that and got the surprising answer.\n\t\u2018They were killed by arrows, not shotguns.\u2019\n\tI wondered why; was there a shortage of cartridges or had possession of the others been illegal, smuggled over from India, so not talked about?  Who was to know?  \u2018Weren\u2019t people very angry?  How is it that I haven't heard people talking about it?\u2019\n\t\u2018I'm telling you.  We eventually got our own back on them.  Parleyed with them on the banks of the River Marsyangdi.  They got drunk; we didn\u2019t.  We won.  The prisoners we caught had to continue life in a much more lowly caste than either group.  Some of them migrated to western Syangja, fifty miles away over the mountains.  None of us talk about it.  That was what my mother had said to me.  We children were not to gossip.  It is dangerous to talk about it, so we don\u2019t.\u2019\n\tI let that pass.  I was intrigued in how long it took to fix a return match, so to speak, so I asked.  My friend was not sure, but maybe it had been about ten years later.\n\tI did a calculation.  That meant the action took place in, say, 1961.  I had heard nothing about it.  Just as well, I supposed, that the western media had not got wind of it, otherwise the Human Rights angle could have been embarrassing.\n\t\u2018After Kalu was killed what happened?\u2019 I asked.\n\tApparently another delegation had been sent to the same family, still in Nawakot, to get another of their sons.  Pushing their luck, was my unspoken comment.\n\t\u2018The mother was most loath to give another of her children, although she had many, seven in all, Kalu being the second.  Eventually the Lamjung villagers prevailed and they were taken up to where the other children were sleeping, all together under the same blanket.  One, the youngest, had crawled above the pillow and was by himself at the head of the bed.  \u2018We'd like him,\u2019 the leader of the delegation said.  He was only seven years old and had to be carried back up to Lamjung.  His name was Yasobam.\u2019\n\tThat was another name I had not come across before.  Again, not wishing to show my ignorance, I kept quiet.\n\tA pause.\n\t\u2018When he came of age he was married in the village.\u2019\n\tThis threw me.  \u2018How long after his arrival would that have been?  If he was only seven when he arrived there, surely that was much too early for any marriage?\u2019\n\tTimes were vague, only the place was in no doubt.  Then there was a son born, so that gave me a clue.  Say, at the earliest, the father was seventeen at the time, which would have put his arrival up in Lamjung earlier than I had been thinking.  Ten years earlier?  That would make the date around 1940.  I don\u2019t like interrupting so I kept my thoughts to myself.\n\t\u2018The son was given the name of Narahari and grew up in the area.  He became the chief after his father died.\u2019\n\tI was really lost now.  The timings were awry.  I tried to work it out to myself.  The narrator\u2019s father was, I knew, born in 1931.  His wife was a few years younger but any trouble that had been of a serious nature would still linger in people's conversations when she was young.  She would remember it well enough to tell her son not to talk about it.\n\t\u2018What happened then?\u2019 I asked after a pause.\n\t\u2018Oh, Narahari Shah stayed on in Lamjung but his younger brother went over to Gorkha to make his mark there.\u2019\n\t\u2018What was the name of the younger brother?\u2019\n\t\u2018Drabya Shah.\u2019\n\t\u2018But, surely, Drabya Shah was the founder of the present royal family 1559?\u2019 I cried out in disbelief, so muddled by now that I had to show my ignorance.\n\t\u2018Yes, that's the one I am telling you about,\u2019 came the patient reply.\n\tA quick mental calculation, my mind in a whirl: \u2018That would put the delegation to Nawakot in around...1493!  That\u2019s over five hundred years ago!\u2019 I burst out.\n\tA sigh; a smile.  \u2018Yes, my mother is afraid the other people will get angry if we start talking about that time.  Those we managed to beat might take it into their heads to do something in return.  She still says it's dangerous to gossip...\u2019\n195***\nIn senescence mundane matters please even more than they have done when younger: Over a period of a couple of weeks I went into a barber\u2019s for a haircut (in England I\u2019d have been asked \u2018which one?\u2019).  At the end I was invited to sit down on a cushioned chair and given a cup to tea, entirely unexpected; on a morning walk three college girls surrounded me for multiple photos (\u2018a thorn between two roses\u2019 would not have been understood); on another walk a man got off his motorcycle and invited me into his house for a drink of milk; the driver of a garbage wagon, on his return from the \u2018dumping site\u2019, stopping his vehicle, calling me over and asking me to put my hand on his head for a blessing as did a bus driver who honked his horn until I turned round and saw him beckoning me.  I went over to him and he, too, asked for a blessing, which I gave him\u2026but why go on?  Little things thus do please.\n\tBecause of Covid my days have changed from saffron to turquoise in that I am not allowed out on my own so have to walk a hundred times round the house, seven miles, playing ball with one of them before my cold shower.\n196***\nBy now, were you to have ploughed you way through all this, you may well ask why I continue to live in Nepal.  It is of curse because of my restricted eyesight and now, in senescence, needing to be looked after.  There are those who disregard the real reasons and say it is because I have \u2018gone native\u2019, never meant anything sbut lightingly.\n\tLet me try to answer that insinuation as objectively as I can: soon after leaving the army I visited England.  A reporter from the local newspaper asked me about my relationship with the Gurkhas, to which my answer was \u2018Do I love them because I understand them or do I understand them because I love them?\u2019\n\tThat was too deep for him to publish and probably as deep as I will ever get.  My answer, some forty years later is \u2018Not sure which but does it matter?\u2019  But whichever way any emphasis is laid, one aspect is certain sure: Gurkhas in particular and Nepalis in general have responded in just proportion, both by what they have said and by how they have said it: in other words, by their reaction to me, by hint, inference or gesture.\n\tThis caused many brother officers, chiefly behind my back, to say \u2018Oh! J P  Cross has gone native!\u2019  \u2018Why?\u2019 I have asked myself.  \u2018Provided military discipline was maintained, such a bond of empathy stimulated an increase in efficiency and, at times, medical recovery which could not otherwise have been engendered.\u2019  And military discipline was maintained, even though my soldiers smiled more often at me than at others.  \u2018With you we know no fear\u2019 was said more than once on operations, as was \u2018you see into our guts and we cannot tell you a lie.\u2019\n\tI invited my mother out to Malaysia when I was commanding the JWS, to Laos when I was DA and to Nepal when I was DRO.  Within a day of her reaching Kathmandu she turned to me and \u2018John, this is where you belong\u2019 and he dying words to me were \u2018Go back to Buddhiman.\u2019  She understood me better than anyone else..\n\tHaving spent ten years in the jungle with Gurkhas I probably know as much about them as any other foreigner.  My knowledge has allowed to influence a dying man who would not eat to eat.  He did and lived; to give so much of myself (pneuma? spirit?) to a cataleptic murderer that he, after total silence for months, explained why he had murdered and when I felt I could no longer sustain myself I pulled myself back inside me: the murderer slumped and never spoke again; to give of myself, weekly for a month, to a leper, who had taken no solid food for a year.  The doctor in charge of the leprosarium called his recovery \u2018miraculous\u2019.\n\tThe dreams I have already described when travelling in Nepal also tell their own story of mental linkage.  Language may also play a part: although I did not start learning Nepali until I was just short of twenty years old, no Nepali takes me for a foreigner on hearing me speak.  Likewise religion: I have been invited to become an honorary Hindu and an honorary Buddhist \u2013 and accepted both.  But, even before that, there was \u2018something other\u2019 that people wanted from me: occasionally first-time pregnant mothers wanting blessings so that their first born be a son; lads to be successful recruits for the British Army and countless students for passing exams.  My success rate is astonishingly high!\n\tThe cause of such empathy was intriguingly stimulated when, living in Nepal after I had left the army.  Two shamans have said that Buddhiman, and I had been born of the same mother in a Christian country to the east.  The nearest \u2018Christian country to the east\u2019 could best refer to the one-time Malla kingdom in the Kathmandu valley when, for maybe a century and a half, Capuchin priests had lived and practised there.  They were expelled only in 1768.\n\tSo, Readers all, take a deep breath before I am laughed out of court \u2013 not for the first time either \u2013 that some part of my former Nepalese d\u00e6mon was reborn in my present incarnation of Christian, English parents, so making me a twin-of-sorts with myself.  In other words, the verb \u2018gone\u2019 is incorrect because my original Nepalese d\u00e6mon has continued to influence my present life in a way the vast majority of all people never experience.\n\tSo what tense should the verb be?  I like to think of it as \u2018is\u2019, native English in England and native Nepali in Nepal.  Also, as an afterthought, that is most likely the reason why I have seemed unconventional at times.\n\tBut let me put on record that for me Asia is a four-letter word, in fact more than one for me there are three: \u2018love\u2019, \u2018care\u2019 and \u2018home\u2019, marking a wonderfully happy ending to a life that has had uncountable challenges \u2013 and never despairing in the darker moments.",

A typical semantic structure is Parts > {Front Matter, Body, Back Matter} => {Foreword, Chapters, Indexes} => {Scenes, Content}. Always go to scene level.\n2. Create a single persona who is representative of the core audience for the book. 3.\nGenerate a list of positive and negative observable traits of the text that influence the persona's enjoyment of the book. Positive observables might include things like vivid language, clear exposition, and strong dramatic structure. Negative observables might include things like cliches, typos, repetitive content, or boring passages. Generate as many traits as you like and make sure that they are tailored to the nature of the synthetic reader persona.\n4. Now proceed through the semantic structure of the book and for each scene evaluate it for the presence of negative and positive observables. Provide a markdown format table with the following columns: scene, positive observable count, negative observable count, comments. Provide the net positive - negative observables.\n5. Provide a list of actionable 'to dos' for the author. \nCreate a chronology of major events discussed in the book in pandoc markdown format. Entries should be presented in format: {full month} {date}, {year}: {event(s)} and MUST be sorted by ascending date.

If many are used, or if a few are used frequently, a list is useful (see fig. 1.8); its location should always be given in the table of contents. If abbreviations are used in the text or footnotes, the list may appear in the front matter. If they are used only in the back matter, the list should appear before the first element in which abbreviations are used, whether the appendixes, the endnotes, or the bibliography. A list of abbreviations is generally not a substitute for using the full form of a term at its first occurrence in the text (see 10.3). In the list, alphabetize terms by the abbreviation, not by the spelled-out form. See also 14.60.\n14.60: Where many abbreviations of titles, manuscript collections, personal names, or other entities are used in a work\u2014say, ten or more\u2014they are best listed alphabetically in a separate section. In a book, the list may appear in the front matter (if footnotes are used) or in the end matter preceding the endnotes (if these are used). It is usually headed \u201cAbbreviations\u201d and should be included in the table of contents (see 1.4, 1.44). Where only a few abbreviations are used, these are occasionally listed as the first section of the endnotes (see fig. 14.7) or at the head of the bibliography.

In the work of the poet Pindar, both are sons of Leda, Queen of Sparta, while Castor is the mortal son of Tyndareus, the king of Sparta, while Pollux is the divine son of Zeus, who raped Leda in the guise of a swan. (The pair are thus an example of heteropaternal superfecundation.)\nIn your updated version, two groups of AI researchers combine to echo Leda, while a vaguely Palantir-like defense company plays a similar role as Tyndareus, and the charismatic and megalomaniacal CEO of an OpenAI-like startup may be slightly reminiscent of Zeus.\nThe AIs are considered 'twins' because they share the same core technology, which stemmed from a team that split into two factions. One team built 'Castor' and the other built 'Pollux'. The AIs took on differing identities and personalities reflecting their differing experiences during training and each team used significantly different techniques as they built on top of the core technology.\n\nYour task is to create five pairs of strikingly different origin stories based on these common themes but diverging dramatically as a result of differing experiences and values during training. The origin stories should be expressed as text prompts for consumption by large language models. Each pair should be represented by a valid JSON object including these keys: pair_name, twin1name, twin1prompt, twin2name, twin2prompt. Each twin takes on a new name and identity during training. The prompts should focus on two types of information: 1) recent (within last 12 months) backstory 2) specific guidance about writing habits, mannerisms, and style. Companies and people should be fictitious.",

Positive observables might include things like vivid language, clear exposition, and strong dramatic structure. Negative observables might include things like cliches, typos, repetitive content, or boring passages. Generate as many traits as you like and make sure that they are tailored to the nature of the synthetic reader persona.\n4. Now proceed through the semantic structure of the book and for each scene evaluate it for the presence of negative and positive observables.
