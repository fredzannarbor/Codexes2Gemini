If, then, we differentiate investigator and practitioner, it is because in the former case action is leisurely and indirect, in the latter case, immediate and anxious. The investigator swings around by a larger loop. But the mental qualities involved are the same. They employ the same method, the same sort of intelligence. And as they get their method and develop their intelligence in the first place at school, it follows that the modern medical school will be a productive as well as a transmitting agency. An exacting discipline cannot be imparted except in a keen atmosphere by men who are themselves 'in training.'"

In the laboratory years this has generally taken place: he will be a dull fellow who does not quickly feel and resent the inferiority of the clinical end. In all fairness, the betterment of the facilities, the change of spirit and ideal, ought to have preceded as the warrant for the higher entrance standard. For the two-year college· standard proclaims a university department. It still remains to be demonstrated that towns like Oma.ha, Washington, San Francisco, Topeka,Milwaukee, can recruit university faculties from the local profession. A university connection or a two-year college entrance requirement do not,of themselves, transform a medical school faculty. They merely impose upon it an additional strain."

But one cannot do both. One cannot simultaneously assert science and dogma; one cannot travel half the road under the former banner, in the hope of taking up the latter, too, at the middle of the march. Science, once embraced, will conquer the whole. Homeopathy has two options: one to withdraw into the isolation in which alone any peculiar tenet can maintain itself; the other to put that tenet into the melting-pot. Historically it undoubtedly played an important part in discrediting empirical allopathy. But laboratories of physiology and pharmacology are now doing that work far more effectively than homeopathy; and they are at the same time performing a constructive task for which homeopathy, as such, is unfit.",

Instincts so profound cannot be abolished by statute. But the limits within which they can play may be so regulated as to forbid alike their commercial and their crudely ignorant exploitation."

Its usefulness as a hospital in its immediate vicinity will be thereby increased; and its service to the colored race at large will be augmented to the extent to which it is used to educate their future physicians. The other two schools lack adequate resources as well as assured prospects. They are surrounded by medical schools-those of Richmond, Baltimore, Philadelphia-whose competition they cannot meet. Finally, the District of Columbia has relatively more physicians than any other part of the country. Should the District require, as it ought, a higher basis, or even enforce an actual four-year high school standard, both would suffer seriously. Neither school is now equal to the task of training physicians of modern type."

The ideals are there; the contiguous departments are there; there is an absence of the distractions which have thus far proved so damaging to city clinicians. A faculty of distinction, with a hospital well equipped for the care of the sick, and for teaching and research, can successfully overcome the most serious difficulties of the situation. The problem can be solved by intelligent organization and liberal support. Gaps may indeed remain in the student's experience. But if he has been well drilled in technique and method, his defects will be readily cured by a hospital year. The solution for Michigan may therefore come, as has been proposed, through an effective affiliation of the hospitals of the state with the school of medicine of the state university. The hospitals would profit by a connection of this kind, and they would assist by becoming factors in the education of the future physicians of the state."

Low as the entrance standard must be, it has been made lower in order to gather in students for six schools where one would suffice. The medical schools solicit and accept students who have not yet made the best of the limited educational opportunities their homes provide; and to this extent, not only injure the public health, but depress and demoralize the general educational situation."
