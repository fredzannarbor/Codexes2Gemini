FOREWORD
Submarines, by their nature, are extreme engineering. At their heart they need
propulsion. Massive diesel engines and their associated machinery are crammed
into small steel hulls. This takes up around half of the space inside. Batteries, required for underwater propulsion, take up another chunk. And the fuel tanks yet
more. All this valuable space given over just to propelling the submarine along.
But what if it fails?
The unusual tale of R-14 verges on myth and legend. Yet it is real, as told here
by David L. Johnston and Ric Hedman. It is a unique story, and one which is entertaining, inspirational and educational.
Today submarine crews are drilled in safety. What to do in the event of fire,
flooding, medical emergencies, gas and so much more is committed to memory.
What to do if you run out of power in the middle of the ocean, with no communications, and only a few days of provisions, is not something you think of.
In 1921, the submarine was called upon to render assistance to a ship in distress. A tug boat had gone missing. Yet R-14 would herself soon become the one
which needed rescuing. Finding herself without power, she drifted, dangerously
low on food and and hope. The ingenuity of the crew saved her, and their lives.
The brave tale of how they improvised to overcome a seemingly impossible situation is valuable for leaders in any domain. How a seemingly mundane task
quickly turned deadly. And how a strong understanding of the basics allowed the
crew to be saved.
The tug boat was not so lucky.
Today perhaps the scenario could not play out the same. The distances involved
feel short by modern standards. Especially with aircraft and faster submarines.
But the ocean is vast, and the same human qualities of resourcefulness, resolve
and teamwork remain every bit as important. The story of R-14 is as much a human tale as a submarine fact check. It is something which everyone can relate to.

PREFACE
There are stories of the sea that involve bravery, perseverance, innovation, adaptation, and strength of character. Some stories highlight the foibles and fallibility of humanity, and many contain lessons for the mariner that still resonate today.
The saga of the submarine USS R-14 (SS-91) during a search and rescue operation off the coast of Hawaii in 1921 certainly contains all of those elements. It is a
story unique in the annals of the United States Navy’s Submarine Service and runs
the gamut from simple human error to inspiring, out-of-the-box problem solving.
PigBoats.COM webmaster and author Ric Hedman first began this story over
10 years ago but never completed it. I have been a close friend and associate of
Ric’s since 2001, assisting him with historical research and photographic analysis.
Ric asked me if I would like to take a crack at it, and after debating for quite some
time, I decided, with Ric’s enthusiastic permission, to finish it. Much of what you
see in the narrative below came directly from Ric’s efforts, I simply refined and
expanded on his earlier work.
The overwhelming majority of the story was lifted directly from the official Log
Book, USS R-14, Jan. 1, 1921 to Dec. 31, 1921. We also used contemporary newspaper
articles, navigational charts, atlases, personal accounts from the crewmembers
and their families, and other printed material as sources. Ric and I have always
emphasized accuracy in our work as historians, and everything that you will read
below is as true to facts as we can possibly make it.
However, we must insert one very large caveat: the spoken dialogue between
the crew was never recorded anywhere and is entirely of our own creation. All of
the principals in this story have long since passed so it can’t be known for sure
what conversations passed between these men. In order to provide the reader
with a personal connection to the story, we wanted to humanize it a bit and thus
the back-and-forth dialogue. Ric and I are both Navy veterans and qualified in
submarines. Ric served on both nuclear and diesel submarines in the 1960s, and I
served on a diesel boat in the 1980s as part of a 21-year career that also included
tours of duty on minesweepers and destroyers. We relied on the experience of

JOHNSTON & HEDMAN

these combined twenty-seven years of naval service to faithfully as possible recreate some of the conversations and scenes contained herein.
A small amount of speculation occurs in other parts of the narrative. For instance, there is a passage where a sailor is discharged from the service, and a short
time later he re-enlisted. That event actually happened because it is documented
in the deck log. However, the actions of the sailor and his shipmates during and
between the two ceremonies is largely our informed speculation.
There are three main purposes to this work: 1) to tell a great and entertaining
sea story; 2) to provide an analysis of the events to the reader so that they may
understand what happened and why; and 3) to provide lessons learned to the present-day Navy in leadership, perseverance, and innovative thinking. There will
be points in this story in which we must adopt a tone critical to the crew, and this
is done in order to discuss the truth of the events. Ric and I have the greatest respect and admiration for Alexander D. Douglas and the crew of the R-14, the bond
of brotherhood to our fellow submariners being quite strong. In no way is it our
desire to sully the memory of anyone’s family member, but in order to learn the
lessons from this incident, it will be necessary to discuss the human mistakes that
were made. We treat all sailors mentioned herein with the greatest respect possible, and we would like to apologize in advance to anyone who might look askance
at our efforts.
Thank you for reading.

Born and raised in the state of Washington, Ric was primarily brought up in
the Seattle area. After high school graduation in 1964 he enlisted in the Navy and
attended boot camp and “A” school in San Diego, CA where he volunteered for
duty in submarines. After attending Submarine School at Submarine Base New
London in Groton CT in 1965, he was assigned to the pre-commissioning crew of
the Thresher class submarine USS Flasher (SSN-613), under construction at General Dynamics/Electric Boat in Groton, CT. After commissioning Flasher changed
homeports to Hawaii, and from there Ric deployed on numerous patrols to the
northern, western and central Pacific. After slightly over four years on active
duty, he transitioned to the Navy Reserve and was assigned to the Submarine Reserve Unit in Seattle, where he completed his six-year military obligation. During
this period, he performed temporary duty on the diesel submarine USS Cusk (SS348), shortly before her decommissioning.
His service awards include the Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation Ribbon,
Navy Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, and the Korean Defense Service Medal. He is qualified in submarines.
While in civilian life he worked in various professions, learning skills that later
served him well. An avid sailor, he operated his own business performing yacht
and small boat repair, and lived on and operated his own sailboat for ten years.
Transitioning jobs once again, he spent 14 years in the Bio-Tech industry in the
Materials Management role, taking several companies from their startup phases
into Food & Drug Administration-approved production of their products.
During this time Ric developed a passion for the early history of the submarine
service and began producing a small web page about that era, learning as he went
along. This culminated in the creation of PigBoats.COM with author and historian
David Johnston. Along the way he has collaborated with numerous authors on
submarine history matters, serving as a technical advisor on approximately a
dozen books and manuscripts. He is a member of the local Seattle base of the
United States Submarine Veterans, Inc. and has been its Base Commander on
three different occasions. He resides in Mountlake Terrace, WA.

AUTHORS’ NOTES & ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
DAVE
One lazy summer afternoon when I was eight years old, I found myself bored,
so I starting perusing my father’s book collection looking for something to pass
the time. There I found a first edition copy of On The Bottom, written in 1929 by
Edward Ellsberg. It was the story of the sinking and salvage of the submarine USS
S-51 (SS-162) in 1925 and 1926. I found it utterly fascinating and I quickly read it
from cover to cover. I didn’t fully understand it at first, as there were some advanced technical stuff in it, but it proved to be the genesis of a life-long fascination
with the sea and submarines. It lead me to join the Navy in 1983 and volunteer for
submarine service. That early fascination stayed with me throughout my service
and in later years. I became a devoted historian, with On The Bottom becoming a
valued member of my library.
Ric Hedman was the original author of this work. He completed the majority of
the research and wrote about thirty-two pages of narrative before experiencing a
severe case of writer’s block. I have been working with Ric as a partner on the web
page PigBoats.COM for twenty years, and one day a few years back Ric approached
me about finishing the story, which I found fascinating. Still on active duty with
the Navy at the time, the project had to wait for my retirement and the completion
of two other projects before I was able to give it the attention that it deserved. I
took Ric’s initial narrative and greatly expanded on it. Ric and I shared hundreds
of phone calls and emails by the time of publication as we worked on the project,
and we equally share in the content of this work, of which we are very proud.
Roy Trent Gallemore’s family have been key contributors of information. The
willingness of Roy’s grandchildren and great grandchildren Bruce Gallemore, Roy
A. Smith, and Katie Eliot to help us and provide insights into their grandfather’s
history and character were a key to success. We would like to pass on to them our
sincere thanks and appreciation.

Noted historian Jim Christley provided background information on the technical aspects of the R-class submarines and his willing assistance is greatly appreciated. His illustrations greatly enhance our work, and for that we are very grateful. Michael Mohl, the webmaster of the submarine pages at Navsource.org, contributed photos and his pages provided very useful research. Author William Tidd
took information from the logs and meticulously created the graphic in Part One
that shows the R-14’s track. My wife Theresa Street was my editor and coach. Her
help, encouragement, and guidance were of inestimable value.
Lastly, to Alexander Dean Douglas, Roy Trent Gallemore, Harry Woodworth,
and the entire 1921 crew of the R-14, Ric and I would like to express our admiration
and gratitude for the lessons in perseverance, innovative thinking, and seamanship. We hope that through this narrative you will not be forgotten.

Without the tremendous assistance of Dave Johnston, this work would never
have seen the light of day. I knew when writing it I didn’t have the right line of
attack on the story and I had wanted it to be more than I had been able to come up
with.
The story began years prior when I was just starting the web page “Through
the Looking Glass”, which later morphed into PigBoats.COM. In about 2000, along
with my local submarine veterans’ group, we made a visit to the USS Alabama
(SSBN-731) when she visited Seattle. In the Chief’s Mess, I saw a framed copy of
the famous photo of the R-14 under sail. I was fascinated with it and it proved to
be an inspiration. A few years later I was contacted by Robert Suess, son of Raymond Suess, who had been aboard the R-14 during the incident and had gotten
himself immortalized as the man standing in the foreground of the sailing photo.
Robert Suess had no one in his family who wanted his dad’s submarine photo collection (many crew and interior images) and wanted to know if I was interested
in having them. I quickly agreed. This collection included an original print of a
public domain photo that resides in the National Archives. I estimated that there
were approximately twenty prints of this photo made after they returned to port,
with the intention of giving one to any crewmember that wanted one. One copy
eventually made it to the National Archives. Suess kept his print for many years
xvii

JOHNSTON & HEDMAN

and even took steps to preserve it by encasing it in an early form of lamination.
There was no doubt this was a prized family possession. It is now framed and
hangs on my wall. Thus began my quest for the full story.
I worked as much of it as I could for a number of years, getting all the research
that could be found from various sources. I soon reached a wall knowing there was
more, but I was at a loss as to the direction that needed to be taken. I tucked it away
only to repeatedly take it out and toy with it. Dave and I had talked about it over
the years. Finally, a decision was reached and the research materials and notebooks were packed and the whole works shipped to Dave. He has taken the story
into the direction where it needed to go, and I’m pleased to no end with the results.
There is undoubtedly more to the story but after a century has passed, people and
resources have about come to their end. The COVID pandemic also made further
information-gathering problematic. I’m hoping that another historian will eventually come up with something we missed and shine the light on a new angle. This,
for now, is about as far as we can take it.
It was tough and Dave was a steadying force. With both of us being Qualified
Submariners we are trained to know and understand the boat’s operations to the
extent that we can operate them in total darkness. We wanted to know the “why”
and found that keeping on track proved difficult at times. We hope you like the
result.
Along with the acknowledgments given by Dave, I’d like to include Raymond
Suess and his family, especially his son Robert, for gifting the whole set of photos
to a complete stranger and making this wonderful story possible.

PUBLISHER’S NOTE
The port city of Hilo on the Big Island of Hawaii plays an important role in this
story as R-14’s emergency destination. It plays an important role in my life, too, as
I spent a month there one summer long ago visiting my mother’s first cousin. For
a gawky kid from the Midwest, indelible memories of tropical beauty, and the
immensity of the Pacific.
As a passionate believer in the importance of the United States Navy, in a
decade where the Navy may well see the first armed conflict with a peer
competitor in many decades, I whole-heartedly endorse the lessons of this book:
both about how catastrophic mistakes are made, and how to respond to them with
resilience, innovation and grace. We’re likely to need that knowledge soon, far
west of Hilo.

MONDAY, 02 MAY 1921, 8:00 A.M.

It is a beautiful day in the United States Territory of Hawaii. It is a still relatively cool 76º F, with a casual southeast breeze of five miles per hour keeping the
oppressive humidity manageable at this early point in the day. Along the south
shore of the isle of Oahu the breeze is creating small wavelets with glassy crests
not yet breaking. The wind is slowly pushing some tenuous cotton puff altocumulus clouds off into the northern Pacific. With the barometer holding steady at
29.90, there are the makings of a fine day here in this Polynesian/American tropical paradise.2
The mouth of Pearl Harbor cuts north from the south shore, with the channel
forming the trunk of an odd-shaped tree as it moves up and spreads out into seven
smaller bays, known to the Navy as lochs. The large central East Loch is broken
into north and south channels by the oblong-shaped Ford Island. Once the site of
a sugar cane plantation, it is now the home of the Army Air Corps Luke Field and
the brand-new Naval Air Station Pearl Harbor, its seaplane ramps and hangars
located at the island’s southeast corner. On the shallow and muddy water within
the harbor, a place revered by the native Hawaiian people and known to be a
birthplace for hammerhead sharks, barely a ripple disturbs the surface, A portion
of the United States Navy’s Pacific Fleet is present on this day.
A small but growing base was established here in 1905 as a coaling station for
the Pacific Fleet ships, and steady work since then expanded the base considerably, supplanting the facilities in nearby Honolulu. The Navy Yard was established
along the south channel adjacent to Ford Island and it contained a hospital, a large
drydock (with three more planned), a foundry, numerous factory-style workshops and warehouses, and several repair basins and piers. The fleet itself was not
yet based here, but its ships made regular port calls during fleet maneuvers. Most

In May, 1921 the USN had not yet adopted the 24-hour clock. All times in the ship’s log are in the
12-hour format, so we will adhere to that standard here.

of the ships actually stationed at the base consisted of patrol craft, auxiliaries and
yard craft, and a contingent of the Pacific Fleet’s submarines.
The site chosen for Submarine Base Pearl Harbor is on the east side of the harbor, at the intersection of Magazine Loch and Quarry Loch. It sits on sandy land
overgrown with tropical scrub brush and prickly cactus, and is just southeast and
a stone’s throw from a small marshy islet called Kuahua. Two finger piers protrude out into Southeast Loch from the triangular-shaped base, and a narrowgauge rail line connecting the small base to the larger nearby Navy Yard meanders
south along the shore of Quarry Loch. The base was willed into existence through
the discipline and determination of its first Commanding Officer (CO), Commander Chester W. Nimitz, and through the gritty hard work of four loyal and
earnest Chief Petty Officers (CPOs) on his staff, who at times resorted to less than
completely honest methods to acquire the scarce materials and assistance needed
to build the base in this remote paradise.3
Submarine Division 14, consisting of 10 R-class submarines, calls the base
home. The division is headquartered on the old and inoperative cruiser USS Chicago (CA-14) moored nearby at a narrow pier at the opening of Magazine Loch. The
R-class submarines were designed and built during the First World War as coastal
patrol boats, with a mission to range out from American bases, patrolling for any
potential enemy that may approach the coastline. Despite their status as coastal
boats, these submarines are among the largest and most capable in use by the USN
in the early 1920s. They are 186 feet long and eighteen feet wide, with a displacement of 574 tons surfaced and 685 tons submerged. Twin NELSECO 6-EB-14 diesel
engines drive them at 12.5 knots surfaced, and when submerged, large storage
batteries provide power to drive electric motors providing a maximum speed of
9.3 knots. There are four 21-inch torpedo tubes forward and each boat carried
eight torpedoes. For surface action there is a 3”/50 caliber Mk 6 gun mounted on
the forward deck. They are outfitted for three officers and twenty-seven crew and
are rated for 30 days at sea.
This day is a busy one, and the finger piers are buzzing with activity. The USS
R-14 (SS-91) is moored alongside sister boat R-11 at Pier 1. The day’s Duty Officer
aboard R-14 is Lieutenant Alexander Dean Douglas, USN, a short and compact,
dark-haired, lean-faced native of Iowa. Douglas is a competent, well-regarded,
and affable officer who to family and friends is known simply as “Dean.” He is

A GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND

officially the boat’s Executive Officer, or second in command; however, for the last
several months he has also been designated as the Acting Commanding Officer.
Due to a shortage of qualified officers at this remote duty station, the boat’s official
CO, Lieutenant Vincent A. Clarke, Jr., has been pulled away for temporary duty as
the Engineering Officer for SUBDIV 14. The division’s CO, Commander Nimitz,
(with additional responsibilities as the CO of Chicago and the Sub Base) has pulled
Clarke to his staff in order to ensure that all of his division’s boats are getting the
repairs and maintenance necessary to be fully operational. Nimitz makes the unusual choice of pulling Clarke from the R-14 without a relief in place because of the
overriding need to fill the division’s gapped Engineering Officer billet. Both Nimitz and Clarke are confident that the younger Douglas can handle the boat; indeed,
if necessary, Clarke is readily available to look over Douglas’ss shoulder, review
his actions, and provide advice. When more officers become available, Nimitz retains the option of officially promoting Douglas to CO and bringing in an ensign to
round out the R-14’s officer billets, or getting the boat a new CO if Douglas needs
more time to season. So far, Douglas has been performing brilliantly.
The last bugle notes of “Carry On” fade away after morning colors and Douglas
presides over the crew mustered for quarters on the pier. With the men lined up
neatly by division in front of him, he waits patiently as the muster roll call is performed. All are present and accounted for, the only exception being a sailor who
is still in the base hospital. Orders for the day are read and work schedules and
assignments are given out. The senior enlisted man on the boat is Chief Gunner’s
Mate (Torpedo) Harry Woodworth of Omaha. In his job as Chief of the Boat, or
COB, Woodworth is the Captain’s get-it-done man. After conferring with Douglas
and the other Department Heads, he is put in charge of the day’s work. Once the
crew has been dismissed, they turn-to and begin cleaning, repairing, painting,
and taking garbage to the containers on the pier. Bedding has been brought topside and is airing over the wire lifelines.
A small ceremony is conducted on the pier at 10:00 a.m. by Douglas, to discharge Machinist Mate 1st class Hugh McNamara from his enlistment in the Navy.
With most of the crew engaged in vital ship’s work, the ceremony is mostly attended by his division work mates. Naval regulations require that a sailor be officially discharged at the end of his enlistment before any further career action can
be taken. After Douglas reads aloud the official notice of Discharge of Enlistment,
cheerful, raucous, and joking suggestions of making a run for it before the Captain
or the COB tries to talk him into re-enlisting fly from his shipmates. The guys slap

him on the back and ask him how it feels to be a civilian again. McNamara fully
intends to re-enlist, but Navy paperwork must be filed and he takes his discharge
papers, hurrying up the pier and over to the Chicago so that the SUBDIV 14 yeoman
can file them and process the re-enlistment papers. The ceremony quickly breaks
up and ten minutes later, the Auxiliaries Department that McNamara is attached
to gets back to work and begins an air charge using both compressors, refilling the
boat’s high-pressure air banks.

northeast from the vicinity of Hospital Point. In the upper center is Kuahua Island, whose
northern end would be eventually filled in to form a peninsula. To the right of Kuahua can be
seen the two finger piers and single building of the budding submarine base, yet to see Nimitz’s full attention. Photo from the 14th Naval District Collection, courtesy of navyhistoryhawaii.blogspot.com.

Figure 9. Submarine Base Pearl Harbor, June 1921. This clearly shows the spartan state of the
base during this time. On the left is the old cruiser Chicago, and in the middle are the two
submarine piers. An Eagle-class patrol boat is moored at Pier #2 with the subs. Magazine Loch
is on the left with Quarry Loch on the right. A road in the background would connect the base
with the towns of Aiea and Kalauao to the left, and the Navy Yard to the right. There also
appears to be a narrow-gauge railroad between the road and buildings. In later years a large
petroleum tank farm would be built in the background and everything on the left and right
would be developed into the growing base. Photo PH146-6-21 courtesy of the Naval History

Figure 10. R-20 and R-12 alongside at Honolulu, circa 1920. This photo provides a good representation of the configuration of the R-class submarines. The conning tower fairwater and
bridge can be seen amidships. The vertical white stripes on R-20 and the white X on R-12 were
part of a system in place, unique to the R-boats in Hawaii, that facilitated long range visual
identification of the boats while surfaced. Just forward of the fairwater is the flared-out deck
for the 3”/50 caliber Mk 6 gun, which is in its stowed position pointed aft. The bow planes are
folded up alongside the forward superstructure, just aft of the anchor. The tube at the bow is
a towing fairlead hawsepipe. The torpedo tubes are below the waterline and not visible. Photo
