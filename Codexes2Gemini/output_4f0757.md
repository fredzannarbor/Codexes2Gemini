This story is about a submarine called the R-14. It's a big, strong submarine that can travel underwater.

One day, the R-14 was sent to find a missing boat called the Conestoga. The
Conestoga was a tugboat that had been towing a barge full of coal. It had been
gone for a long time, and the navy was worried.

The R-14 got ready to go, but they made a mistake. They thought they had
enough fuel to last for ten days, but they didn't!

They ended up running out of fuel in the middle of the ocean. They were stuck!
The sailors on the R-14 were very smart, though. They knew how to use sails
on boats, so they made their own sails out of blankets and canvas. They rigged
them up to the masts on their submarine, and used the wind to help them sail to
Hilo, a port on another island.

They had to use the wind to power the submarine because they didn’t have
enough electricity left in their batteries. They made the sails from blankets and
canvas that they had on board. The R-14 was never meant to use sails, but it
worked!

It took them a few days to get to Hilo, but they finally made it. The other sailors in the navy were very impressed that they managed to save themselves. The
R-14 was a very brave submarine!

They found out that the Conestoga had actually sunk a long time ago in a storm
near California. The R-14 had been searching in the wrong place.

Even though they didn't find the Conestoga, the R-14's story is an example of
how teamwork, creativity, and a little bit of luck can help us overcome any problem.



## TLDR (three words)

## Scientific-Style Abstract

This narrative details the unusual incident of the USS R-14 (SS-91) in 1921
while conducting a search and rescue mission for the missing USS Conestoga
(AT-54) off the coast of the Hawaiian Islands. It analyzes the historical and technical details of the event, demonstrating how simple human error led to a
situation that required creative thinking and problem solving by the crew. The
narrative outlines the specific shortcomings in leadership, oversight, and organizational procedures that led to the event, and then analyzes the actions that
the crew took to recover from the incident. It concludes with a discussion of the
lessons learned from this event and how they apply to modern naval operations.

## ELI5
Imagine a book about a submarine that got lost at sea. It’s like a big, underwater car! But it ran out of fuel! 
This book tells the story of how the submarine’s crew was able to use their smarts and ingenuity to get
home. They even rigged up sails on their submarine, just like the sailboats you see at the beach! It’s a
pretty cool story. 
The book also has a special section at the beginning with notes from the authors explaining how they
wrote the book and a section at the end listing all the books and papers they used to write the
story. There’s even a glossary at the back so you can understand all the fancy words they use! 

## TLDR (three words)
Submarine sails home.
