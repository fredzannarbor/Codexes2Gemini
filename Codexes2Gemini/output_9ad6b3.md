# Glossary. Context: STORY OF THE DOOR

This glossary explains technical terms in the context of Robert Louis Stevenson's *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*.

**Apothecary:** A person who prepares and sells medicines. In the story, the doctor is described as a "cut-and-dry apothecary," implying he is more of a traditional, uninspired pharmacist rather than a groundbreaking medical professional.

**Black-mail:** Extorting money from someone by threatening to reveal damaging information about them. This is the crime Mr. Enfield suspects is occurring at the "Black-Mail House" with the mysterious door.

**Cabinet:** A private room, often used as a study or office. In the story, Dr. Jekyll's cabinet is where he conducts his experiments and transforms into Mr. Hyde.

**Cheval-glass:** A tall, full-length mirror. This reflects the changes in Jekyll's appearance as he transforms into Hyde.

**Circulars:** Printed notices or advertisements distributed widely.  In the context of the story, Poole says only circulars were delivered by post, highlighting the unusual nature of the letter Jekyll receives.

**Connoisseur:** An expert, especially in matters of art or taste. Dr. Jekyll is described as a connoisseur, suggesting he has refined tastes and appreciates quality. 

**Coutts's:** A famous London bank still in existence today. The fact that Mr. Hyde draws a check on Coutts's highlights his access to wealth and respectability, despite his unsavory reputation. 

**Dispensing chemist:** A pharmacist who prepares and dispenses medicines. The fact that Jekyll's powders are not made with the "nicety" of a dispensing chemist suggests his experiments are not regulated by professional standards.

**Dissecting-rooms:** Rooms where corpses are dissected for medical study. This location is relevant because Jekyll's experiments involve transforming his body, a process that could be compared to dissecting or re-assembling it.

**Edinburgh accent:** A distinctive accent from the Scottish capital, Edinburgh.  The doctor's use of this accent suggests a connection to Scotland and potentially, a history of traditional medicine and science.

**Fan-light:** A semicircular window above a door.  The description of the fan-light above Dr. Jekyll's door emphasizes the comfort and respectability of his home, a stark contrast to the sinister "Black-Mail House."

**Fog:** A thick mist that frequently enveloped London in the 19th century. The fog serves as both a literal and metaphorical barrier in the story, obscuring and concealing the truth, much like the secrets surrounding Jekyll and Hyde. 

**Gin palace:** A pub or bar that served primarily gin, often frequented by the working class. This setting represents a place of vice and potentially, hidden darkness, which contrasts with the respectability of Jekyll's home. 

**Graduated glass:** A glass marked with measurements, typically used for measuring liquids. The presence of this tool in Lanyon's lab foreshadows the use of chemicals and concoctions in Jekyll's transformation.

**Hansom:** A type of two-wheeled horse-drawn cab popular in Victorian England. This form of transportation, with its closed compartment, provides anonymity, which Mr. Hyde utilizes to avoid detection.

**Holograph:** A document entirely handwritten by the author. This detail about Jekyll's will emphasizes its personal nature and the deliberate decision to withhold legal assistance in its creation.

**Hyde-bound pedant:** A term used to describe Dr. Lanyon, implying he is a rigid and narrow-minded individual who adheres to traditional scientific principles, even to the point of being dogmatic.

**Juggernaut:** A large, heavy, unstoppable force. This comparison highlights Mr. Hyde's overwhelming power and the destructive force he unleashes.

**Laboratory:** A room or building where scientific experiments are conducted. Jekyll's laboratory is the site of his transformative experiments, and where he stores his chemicals. 

**Lockfast drawer:** A drawer that can be secured with a lock. The description of the lockfast drawer in Hyde's room suggests his desire to keep secrets hidden, adding to the intrigue.

**Maw's:** A real, established pharmaceutical company in 19th-century London. The reference to this company adds a sense of realism and credibility to the story's details.

**Minims:** A very small unit of liquid measurement.  This precise unit of measurement further underscores the scientific nature of Jekyll's experiments and the intricate control he attempts to exert over the transformative process.

**Morbid:**  Unhealthy, excessive, or preoccupied with death.  This term describes both Jekyll's fear of misdirection in his letter to Lanyon and his preoccupation with the dark side of his nature, highlighting his internal turmoil.

**Penny numbers:** Cheap, sensationalist publications sold for a penny.  The shop selling these publications represents a low-brow form of entertainment and possibly, a source of gossip or scandalous information, reinforcing the theme of hidden secrets and social divisions in the story.

**Phosphorus:** A highly reactive, flammable element that glows in the dark. This chemical element is mentioned as part of the potion Jekyll concocts, emphasizing its potential for both wonder and danger. 

**Pious:**  Devoutly religious.  The fact that Jekyll annotates a pious work with blasphemies reveals the conflicting nature of his beliefs and the struggle between his good and evil sides.

**Policeman:** A member of the police force. The presence of a policeman in the square outside Lanyon's house is significant because it adds to the suspense and danger surrounding Hyde's visit. 

**Poole:** Dr. Jekyll's butler.  Poole is a loyal and observant servant who becomes a key player in the unraveling of the mystery, recognizing the true nature of Hyde and witnessing the disturbing changes in Jekyll.

**Postmark:** A stamp on a letter indicating the date and location of mailing.  The absence of a postmark on Hyde's letter to Jekyll is a suspicious detail that adds to the intrigue and reinforces the idea that Hyde is operating in secrecy.

**Proprieties:**  The accepted rules of behavior and decorum.  The person who drew the check is described as the "pink of the proprieties," suggesting they are highly respected and adhere to social norms, making their connection to Hyde all the more unsettling.

**Regent's Park:** A large public park in London.  This setting represents a place of public life and beauty, a stark contrast to the shadowy world inhabited by Hyde.

**Respectability:**  A state of being highly regarded and respected within society. This is a central theme in the story, as Jekyll desperately seeks to maintain his respectability while indulging in secret vices.

**Troglodytic:**  Relating to cave-dwelling people or characterized by primitive behavior. This term reflects Mr. Utterson's impression of Mr. Hyde, suggesting an instinctual, almost animalistic quality to him.

**Utterson:** A lawyer and friend of Dr. Jekyll.  Utterson is a rational and observant man, but even he is deeply disturbed by the events surrounding Jekyll and Hyde. His investigation drives the plot forward and forces Jekyll to confront the consequences of his actions.

**Vintages:**  Wines of a particular year and region, typically considered to be of high quality. This detail reveals Jekyll's self-discipline and his attempt to deny himself certain indulgences.

## For Idiots Only:  The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

**Imagine this:**  There's this guy, Mr. Utterson, who's a lawyer. He's kinda boring, but also kinda nice. He has a friend, Dr. Jekyll, who's super smart and respected. But Jekyll has a secret. He's got this dark side, a nasty little guy named Hyde, who's like the opposite of Jekyll. 

**Here's what happens:**

* Enfield, another friend of Utterson, tells him a story about Hyde being super mean and trampling over a little girl. He also says that Hyde is connected to a mysterious door in a creepy part of town.
* Utterson gets suspicious. He checks out Jekyll's will and sees that everything goes to Hyde if Jekyll disappears.  Utterson is worried, thinking maybe Jekyll is in trouble with Hyde.
* Utterson tries to talk to Dr. Lanyon, another friend of Jekyll, but Lanyon is weirded out by Jekyll's behavior. He doesn't know anything about Hyde. 
* Utterson then spots Hyde and talks to him.  Hyde is creepy and makes Utterson feel super uncomfortable. 
* Utterson learns that Hyde has a key to Jekyll's house and is allowed to go in and out.  
*  A rich guy, Sir Danvers Carew, is brutally murdered by Hyde.  Utterson finds out about the murder and recognizes the murder weapon as one he gave Jekyll.
* Utterson goes to Hyde's house and sees that the place has been ransacked. The police find proof that Hyde is the killer, but he's gone.
*  Utterson goes to Jekyll's house and finds him very sick and scared.  Jekyll tells Utterson that he's done with Hyde and gives him a letter from Hyde.
*  Utterson reads the letter from Hyde and is relieved because it suggests that Hyde is actually afraid of Jekyll. But then he hears from his servant that a letter has been delivered, but he has no idea who brought it.
* Jekyll acts strange and won't see Utterson anymore.  Lanyon dies suddenly and leaves a letter for Utterson.  Utterson is told not to open it until Jekyll dies or disappears.
*  Utterson sees Jekyll from a distance and Jekyll looks terrified. 
*  Jekyll's servant, Poole, goes to Utterson and says something is wrong with Jekyll and he's locked himself in his lab.
* Utterson goes with Poole to the lab and hears Jekyll's voice behind the locked door.  They break in and find Hyde dead.
*  Utterson finds Jekyll's confession and a letter from Lanyon.  

**The Big Reveal:**

* Lanyon's letter explains that Jekyll had a secret potion that transformed him into Hyde.  Hyde was basically Jekyll's evil alter ego.  Jekyll had been trying to control Hyde, but eventually, Hyde became too powerful.
* Jekyll's confession explains how he created the potion and how he tried to separate his good and bad sides.  But the potion only made Hyde stronger and Jekyll weaker.  In the end, Jekyll couldn't control Hyde anymore and Hyde took over. 
*  Jekyll is dead, and Hyde dies by taking too much of the potion.  

**So basically, the story is about a guy who tried to split his personality into good and bad and it went terribly wrong!**


## For Idiots Only

Context: STORY OF THE DOOR

This is like a detective story where the main character, Mr. Utterson, is trying to figure out what's going on with his friend, Dr. Jekyll. 

**The Story So Far:**

Mr. Utterson is a lawyer who is very close to Dr. Jekyll.  He's a bit of a grump, but he's a good guy who wants to help people.  One day, Mr. Utterson's other friend, Mr. Enfield, tells him a weird story about a creepy little man named Hyde.  Hyde was involved in a really bad incident where he stomped on a little girl, then later used a key to get into a mysterious building and gave Mr. Enfield a check for a huge amount of money.

Mr. Utterson is intrigued by this, because he knows Dr. Jekyll has a will that leaves everything to Hyde if anything happens to him.  He thinks maybe Hyde is blackmailing Jekyll for something he did in the past.

He starts to look into Hyde and goes to the building with the door to see if he can get a look at the guy. He ends up meeting Hyde and gets a real bad feeling about him. He doesn't like Hyde at all, and thinks he might be dangerous.

Mr. Utterson visits Dr. Lanyon, another friend of Jekyll's, to see if he knows anything about Hyde. Lanyon says he's never heard of him and thinks Jekyll has gone a bit crazy. 

**The Big Twist:**

Then, a guy named Sir Danvers Carew is brutally murdered in the street by someone who looks exactly like Hyde. Mr. Utterson goes to Hyde's house and finds the place trashed and evidence that Hyde was there. 

Mr. Utterson then goes to Dr. Jekyll's house and finds out that Hyde has a key to the place.  He also learns that Jekyll got a letter from Hyde saying that he's safe and doesn't need Jekyll's help.  Jekyll asks Mr. Utterson to hold onto the letter.

Later on, Mr. Utterson is at his house when his butler, Poole, comes running in, freaked out. He says that Jekyll has locked himself in his lab and is acting strange.  He says he's been trying to get a special medicine for Jekyll for a week, but the doctor keeps saying it's not pure and wants a different kind. 

Poole also tells Utterson that he saw Jekyll in the lab, but he was wearing a mask and acted scared of him.  He says that the masked figure looked a lot like Hyde. 

**The Climax:**

Mr. Utterson and Poole decide to break into Jekyll's lab to see what's going on. They find the body of Hyde in the lab, and learn that he killed himself.

They go through the rest of the lab and find a will that leaves everything to Mr. Utterson if Jekyll dies.  They also find a letter from Jekyll saying that he's gone, and that Mr. Utterson should read Lanyon's letter to find out what happened. 

**The Big Reveal:**

Mr. Utterson then reads the letters from Jekyll and Lanyon, and finds out that Jekyll has been experimenting with a potion that can transform him into a completely different person: Hyde.
