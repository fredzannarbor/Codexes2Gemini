It evaluates the damage to US intelligence activities and provides recommendations for improvement. The report highlights potential damage to US SIGINT capabilities against China's tactical sources and methods  as well as the need to address complacency regarding safeguarding sensitive information. It discusses the compromise of classified and sensitive Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and Communications Security (COMSEC) equipment and information  as well as deficiencies in policy and emergency procedures. The report also addresses the compromise of cryptographic equipment and materials and the potential impact on foreign relations. It provides recommendations for improving the security and operations of the U.S. Navy Cryptologic system  including limiting classified materials onboard and refining procedures for key supersession. Overall  the report emphasizes the need for coordination  communication  and emergency procedures in handling such incidents.

It contains a then-unique historical table of suicide bombings 1980-2006 as well as many  enduring insights about the strategic ramifications of this despicable weapon of ""war"".</p><p><br></p><p>From the author's abstract:</p><p>This monograph analyzes recent post-1980 suicide bombings and determines the probability of such bombings occurring in the Continental United States CONUS. The analysis includes a brief history of modern suicide bombing an examination of the strategic  tactical  social  and individual logic of suicide bombing a discussion of the probable characteristics of suicide bombings against the United States  both within CONUS and abroad and recommendations about what can be done to mitigate future bombings. Suicide attackers have been a part of warfare for over two millennia  but the coupling of suicide attackers and explosives greatly increased the importance and effectiveness of this tactic in the 20th century. The modern phenomenon of suicide bombing had its genesis in the Iran-Iraq War from 1980-88. Concurrent with the Iran-Iraq War  Iran influenced the development of Hezbollah in Lebanon. Hezbollah tried suicide bombing against the United States and France  and then later against Israel. Other groups such as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam LTTE  the Palestinians  and the Peoples Liberation Army of Kurdistan PKK started employing suicide bombers in the 1980s and 1990s. As suicide bombing spread geographically and ideologically  it also increased in sophistication. It advanced from being a simple bomb delivered by truck  to include suicide vests  boat bombs  and eventually airplanes. The vast majority of suicide bombings 98 are part of an organized campaign. The only group that conducts suicide bombings against the United States outside of active war zones is Al-Qaida. Al-Qaida attacks have evolved to the point where there are two different strains al-Qaida-sponsored and al-Qaida-inspired. Both are likely to occur in the continental United States within the mid-future. Appendix A lists 2 202 suicide bombings that have occurred since 1980. As of early 2007  this is the best available open source suicide bombing database in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>This annotated edition illustrates the capabilities of the AI Lab for Book-Lovers to add context and ease-of-use to manuscripts.

The amalgam of 247 news networks  mass media  the Internet  and social media the mediaverse  coupled with mobile technology  influences strategy in three ways. First  it is a national security challenge and opportunity. Second  it influences the character of war. Third  it is forcing an evolution of the strategic environment. The successful strategic leader must be not just aware but au courant on the challenges and opportunities presented by the mediaverse. Improved processes  tools  and education are required to adapt to mediaverse influencers. The most significant systemic improvement is the addition of a robust strategic feedback loop in the strategy formulation model. This can be accomplished by better integrating information operators into campaign planning and mission execution to surveil the mediaverse to assess content and on-going events to provide a robust assessment of the information environment. Formal developmental education should expand current media training to include skillful reconnaissance of  and engagement in  the mediaverse.</p><p><br></p><p>This forty-page thesis is enhanced by AI analytical tools including  five kinds of summaries; four introductory essays to provide viewpoint diversity; a page-by-page summary; and a table of notable passages.</p><p><br></p><p>Cover illustration: the Nimble Books staff artist used a large language model (LLM) to generate a series of ""metaprompts"" based on the content of the document that resulted in the followiung art generation prompt:</p><p><br></p><p><span>Book cover illustration visualizing the mediaverse's complex impact on strategy.

The report covers a range of issues  including the FBI's use of surveillance orders  the reliability of sources  the handling of the Steele dossier  and the Alfa Bank and Yotaphone allegations.</p><p><br></p><p>The report finds that the FBI made numerous errors and omissions in its handling of the investigation  including failing to follow its own policies and procedures  failing to adequately vet and corroborate information from sources  and failing to disclose important information to the FISA court. The report also criticizes the FBI's handling of the Steele dossier  which it says was relied upon too heavily and without sufficient corroboration. Additionally  the report highlights the Alfa Bank and Yotaphone allegations  which were based on flimsy evidence and were promoted by individuals with ties to the Clinton campaign.</p><p><br></p><p>The report makes a number of recommendations for improving the FBI's handling of counterintelligence investigations  including better vetting of sources  more transparency in FISA applications  and more rigorous oversight of investigations. The report also calls for the FBI to take steps to address bias and improper motivation in its investigations.</p><p>    </p><p>Overall  the report paints a picture of an FBI that was overly reliant on questionable sources and evidence  and that failed to adequately scrutinize the information it was using to justify its surveillance of the Trump campaign. While the report does not find evidence of political bias in the FBI's handling of the investigation  it does highlight a number of serious flaws in the agency's procedures and practices.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Annotations</strong></p><p><br></p><p>AI enhancements include a Foreword by Cincinnatus [AI]; several different Abstracts including tldr(one word); tldr; ELI5; and Action Items; extractive  recursive  and virtual context summaries; mood sketches created using text to image tools; and a Homeric Table of Contents  summarizing each page in a short ode.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>,,"Alfa Bank allegations,applications targeting Page,campaign-funded Steele Reports,Clinton Plan intelligence,Company Intelligence Report,Crossfire Hurricane Investigation,FBI Counterintelligence Investigation,FBI interview report,FBI OGC Unit,FISA applications Page,Inspection Division Report,Mueller Special Counsel,Steele Dossier reporting,Steele Report information,targeting Carter Page,uncorroborated Steele Report",B&W 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,358,Y,,,23-May-23,23-May-23,24.99,20.99,33.99,23.99,37.99,30,30,30,30,30,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,24.99,,24.99,24.99,24.99,24.99,24.99,24.99,24.99,24.99,30,,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,N,6024045,W.

It was an unprecedented attack on our democracy and its devastating consequences are still reverberating throughout our country. In the days that followed  it has become clear that prior to this tragic event  several federal agencies identified credible threats leading up to the MAGA I and MAGA II demonstrations in Washington D.C.  yet many questions remain about how those threats were assessed and responded to.</p><p><br></p><p>The General Accounting Office (GAO) report 'Capitol Attack' dives deep into these questions using open source data and related threat products to investigate what went wrong.

The report identifies key factors such as non-compliant DeFi services  disintermediation  a lack of implementation of international anti-money laundering/counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards in foreign countries  and cybersecurity weaknesses in DeFi services that continue to pose vulnerabilities that enable criminal use of DeFi services.</p><p><br></p><p>The report highlights the vulnerabilities and potential exploits in open-source code  which can lead to widespread exploits if code reused in multiple DeFi services contains vulnerabilities. The public availability of many DeFi services' source code also presents the opportunity for other persons to reuse the code in smart contracts for a separate DeFi service.

The court order was issued by United States District Judge Thomas O. Rice in the Eastern District of the United States on April 7  2023. The plaintiffs argue that the FDA's current Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for mifepristone  which includes restrictions on distribution and administration  is unnecessary and imposes undue burdens on patients and healthcare providers  particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The court finds that there are serious issues going to the merits of the plaintiffs' claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and that the alleged unrecoverable economic costs in this case are sufficient to demonstrate irreparable harm. The court grants the preliminary injunction in part  enjoining the FDA from enforcing the in-person dispensing requirement for mifepristone during the COVID-19 pandemic and maintaining the status quo of the current REMS program until a determination on the merits.</em></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><em>The court order also denied a third party's unopposed motion for leave to file an amicus curiae brief  noting that the proposed brief offered no additional legal or substantive information that was particularly helpful to the court's findings on the present motion.

This illuminating report on the proposed use of tactical nuclear weapons in Southeast Asia was written in 1967 by a four-man team from the JASON scientific advisory committee  including Freeman J. Dyson. This groundbreaking work examines the potential consequences had tactical nuclear weapons been utilized during the Vietnam War. It examines a range of topics including arms control  targeting strategies  and the potential effects of nuclear war on civilian populations. The authors take a comprehensive approach to their subject matter and provide valuable insights into how these weapons could have been used in Southeast Asia had they been available. This book is essential reading for anyone interested in understanding the complex nature of tactical nuclear weapons as well as their potential consequences in modern warfare. It provides a fascinating look at one of history's most explosive topics and offers important lessons for today's conflicts involving TNWs. Most notably  much larger numbers of warhead uses would be required than most modern commentators are even imagining.  The reason is that tactical military units are small  well dispersed  and difficult to target. The JASON team found an estimate of 10 weapons/day  or 3000 year  to be plausible.This edition is annotated by Nimble AI with twenty-four pages of front matter and includes a Foreword by Shiva [AI]  Nimble's Contributing Editor for nuclear weapons and strategy; Abstracts including scientific style  tldr  tldr one word  and Explain It to Me Like I'm Five  Years Old  Action Items; Viewpoints including MAGA Perspectives and Red Team Critique; a recursive summary with synopsis; a page-by-page summary; and interior art by artist herb.loc['AI']Books in the AI Lab for Book-Lovers series uae AI to make the experience of reading books richer.,Nuclear weapons were used to stop enemy troops  with 40 targets attacked and 70-100 10-KT weapons fired.

It is a must-read for anyone interested in the history of armored warfare  the Soviet and Russian armies  and the history of the modern battlefield.Soviet ground force tactical units conducted night attacks in  accordance with a theoretical model that lasted through the Cold War.

Dr. James Tritten ably articulated the value of naval doctrine in this historical survey for the Naval Doctrine Command. In subsequent decades  USN doctrine evolved in response to changing circumstances  in some instances successfully  in some instances not. The USN abandoned long-distance strike aircraft in a doctrinal pursuit of sorties-to-shore  wasted decades on a Littoral Combat Ship that was almost literally all doctrine  and saw its seakeeping readiness degrade at a level even more fundamental than the doctrinal. Today  the US Navy is faced with an existential threat from a peer competitor that can outrange it  outshoot it  and outbuild it. Getting naval doctrine right has never been more critical. Understanding its history is a necessary first step that will repay investment for anyone interested in American sea power: that is  American national power.From the author's abstract:<ul><li>Navy doctrine has existed in the past [it is not new]; <li>It is proper to study the doctrinal lessons of other nations and other services; important doctrinal lessons can be drawn from history; <li>Formal navy doctrine suffered a setback with the introduction of new technologies and the end of the Anglo-Franco wars in the Nineteenth Century; <li>Pre-war military doctrine cannot forseee all eventualities; <li>Centralized military doctrine should not be cast in stone; <li>Military doctrine has changed due to a variety of circumstances; <li>It is not easy to institute a significant doctrinal change in large organizations; it appears easier to change military doctrine when it is written; <li>Measures of effectiveness are needed for military doctrine;<li>Successful navy doctrine has been prepared by a variety of individuals; <li>Doctrine must be meaningful;<li>Joint and multinational doctrine become more important as national forces downsize; <li>Multinational doctrine for navy forces will be inherently different than multinational doctrine for land forces; <li>There is no one correct military doctrine; <li>There is a doctrinal renaissance in progress; <li>Good military doctrine is of no value without good men and women who are trained and provided the proper equipment;<li>And naval doctrine is not risk free.</ul>This book is annotated by Nimble AI and includes a Foreword by ; a variety of pithy  opinionated abstracts including scientific style  tldr  tldr one word  Explain It to Me Like I'm Five Years Old  and Action Items; tools for viewpoint diversity such as Dissents  Red Team Critiques  and MAGA Perspectives; a recursive summary with synopsis; page-by-page summaries; and interior art by artist herb.loc['AI'].""""",In 1995  the end of the Cold War found the US Navy grappling with the doctrine that woud determine its role and its future.,"Naval Doctrine Command; Burke, Admirals; Holloway, Admirals; Kidd, Joe; Maglietta, Alfredo; McCaffrie, Jack; doctrine; Sun Tzu; Delbruck; multinational doctrine; joint doctrine",B&W 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,74,,,,21-Mar-23,21-Feb-23,18.99,15.99,26.99,17.99,28.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,18.99,,18.99,18.99,18.99,18.99,18.99,18.99,18.99,18.99,30,,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

From the author's abstract:Since the advent of aviation  aircraft have migrated from intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance(ISR) to weapons platforms. Balloons  airplanes  and UAVs all began as a means to observe the battlefield but were later armed in order to attack the observed enemy.

The torpedo  then as now  is the ultimate close-range weapon for sinking ships; a mission that remains essential today.This book  published in 1890 by the United States Naval Torpedo Station (Newport  R.I.)  was a comprehensive guide on how to connect  prime  and test spar torpedoes; fill them with gun-cotton; connect the wires using circuit-closers  and more.  Spar torpedoes were attached to a spar on the bow of the ship and meant to detonate on contact with an enemy. Needless to say  the nature of the weapon presupposed that it would be deployed. By bold and skillful seamen.In this manual readers will discover a detailed overview of torpedo technology as well as helpful instructions for every stage of handling these powerful weapons. The step-by-step approach makes it easy to understand even complex topics like wiring diagrams and primers that may be too confusing otherwise. The US Naval Torpedo Station experts provided their expertise on topics that range from basic torpedo assembly checkout procedures all the way up to intricate explosion mechanisms. This document reflects well on the technical capabilities of the US Navy at the end of the 19th Century. But it also sheds light on the requirements for naval success at the beginning of the 21st Century.

Meanwhile  we learn about current events related to international relations occurring above water - such as increased tension with Russia - that are just as vital when it comes to ensuring everyone remains safe while exploring new horizons.Discovering the strategic maneuverings around the Earth's Seventh Sea should not only create excitement but also consider the issue more broadly-what other new strategic theatres will open up in the remainder of the 21st Century? Space; the Moon; the deep sea and seabed; ""climate migration zones""; AI versusAI conflicts?

Guglielmotti was motivated by a desire to improve the understanding of naval and military terms among the Italian people. He felt that a better understanding of these terms would lead to a greater appreciation of Italy's rich maritime history.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">  Italy was beginning her growth into one nation-state for which she needed a navy with an intellectual foundation-a navy fully equipped with officers who were cross-trained as engineers/seamen/soldiers-which both Cavour's politics and Guglielmotti's efforts contributed greatly toward enabling. It is apparent that this book was written at that historic moment when Italy embarked on building such an apparatus which required that she first construct a new vocabulary within which her people might also learn how best to interact with others around them-even those outside Italy proper. Therefore there was &nbsp;a need for a changeover from what had been primarily a defensive emphasis on her thinking about warships up until then toward an offensive capability so that she might sail out upon the seas.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">  Guglielmotti believed that a classical education was essential for a proper understanding of naval terminology. He therefore sought to provide definitions in a precise and exact manner  using classical references where possible.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">  The author's approach is modern in many ways.

During his military career he served on the aircraft carriers USS Coral Sea and USS Enterprise and later at the Naval Weapons Test Center, Port Hueneme, California. He also worked on the first cruise missile tests in what would become the Tomahawk program.Mr. Hinds grew up in Needles, California. In this desert river town he was greatly influenced by the National Speed Boat Races. These events featured small, fast boats that were civilian echoes of the torpedo boats of the world's navies.Mr. Hinds was involved in both technical and editorial illustration. His career includes working in the business community as an independent graphics project manager, illustrator and designer for American Honda Motor Company, British Petroleum/HITCO, Martin Marietta, Grey Advertising, BBDO Los Angeles and others. His art appeared in magazines such as Private Pilot, Plane and Pilot, Cycle World, Civil War Times Illustrated, America in World War II, and others.In pursuit of historical accuracy, he was  fortunate to work with distinguished museum curators, Joe Judge (Curator, Hampton Roads Naval Museum), Bob Holcombe (Curator, Confederate Naval Museum, and Dana Wegner (Curator, US Navy Ships Model Museum. Mr. Hinds has also worked closely with Jeff Johnston, Program Specialist and Dr. John Broadwater, Manager of the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary-NOAA. This collaborative effort led to illustrations of the USS Monitor and CSS Virginia (ex-Merrimack). These illustration, sold as prints, show numerous details of these two historic vessels that have never been shown before. Mr. Hinds' illustrations of several Civil War vessels appeared In Civil War Times magazine from 1999 to 2006. At that same time he began work with the Discovery Channel to produce an accurate illustration of the US Navy Civil War submarine Alligator. This illustration was subsequently used by NOAA as an international distributed poster to celebrate the achievements of the USS Alligator during the American Civil War. This illustration was produced with the aid of master model builders and submarine historians, a necessity since no contemporary plans or photographs of the Alligator exist. The final product produced by Mr. Hinds was used in television productions, posters and other products.Mr. Hinds has completed the first comprehensive treatment of torpedo boats. This monumental research effort on the development of the torpedo boat in the world's navies has produced a series of illustrations and narrative accounts, as well as voluminous research files. Hinds have pushed back the timeline on the invention of the torpedo to 1280 AD thanks to assistance from Dr. Ahmad Y. Al-Hussan, Cambridge University. One part of the effort, the story of PT-34, recently appeared in the magazine America in World War II with a second article detailing the second PT boat heroic action by President John F. Kennedy.By combining his avocation for naval history with his vocation in illustrating, Mr. Hinds made lasting contributions to the history of the world's navies.",,,HIS027340,HISTORY / Military / Vehicles / Sea (see also TRANSPORTATION / Ships & Shipbuilding / Submarines),HIS027150,HISTORY / Military / Naval,TEC060000,TECHNOLOGY & ENGINEERING / Marine & Naval,Nimble Books LLC,1,,,<p>Volume 1: Overview</p><p>Volume 2: Timeline 1585 - 1899</p><p>Volume 3: Timeline 1900 - 1939</p><p>Volume 3: Timeline 1900-August 1939</p><p>Volume 4: Timeline September 1939-1940</p><p>Volume 5: Timeline 1941</p><p>Volume 6: Timeline 1942</p><p>Volume 7: Timeline 1943</p><p>Volume 8: Timeline 1944</p><p>Volume 9: Timeline 1945</p><p><br></p><p>Appendices and special features from Volumes 10 and 11 include:</p><p><br></p><p><em>CSS (Confederate States Ship) David Class Torpedo Boat: 1863</em></p><p><em>USN Torpedo Boat No.5  Spuyten Duyvil</em></p><p><em>The Herreshoff Brothers</em></p><p><em>The Torpedo Boat Winslow  TB-5</em></p><p><em>The Raven's Wrath</em></p><p>Appendix A.

It was a success from the start and has become the standard reference directory on the topic. The Naval Warrant Officer's Journal suggested that the book be on every ship, and in 1902 said that it should be available to every naval officer. The Admiralty were less enthusiastic, partly due to Jane's irreverent behaviour - although some ships did acquire copies.",,,HIS027150,HISTORY / Military / Naval,HIS027090,HISTORY / Wars & Conflicts / World War I,,,Nimble Books LLC,1,,,,,"<p class=""ql-align-justify"">Ever since its first edition in 1898  Jane's <em>Fighting Ships</em> has been the go-to information source for navalists. As a result past issues of <em>Jane's </em>are an irreplaceable source of contemporaneous perspectives on the world's navies. Flipping through <em>Jane's</em> for 1898 or 1906 or 1939  you are seeing through the eyes of history.  Unfortunately  most past editions are no longer in print and can only be obtained via interlibrary loan  which can be slow and unreliable  or by purchasing used  which are scarce and expensive (starting at typically about double the list price of these volumes).  </p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">To fill the gap  this is a facsimile edition produced from the best available scan. No hardcopy was available at the time of publication. &nbsp;Of the 604 pages in the scan  10 were considered so deficient that they should not be included.&nbsp;They were replaced with blank pages  and glaring scanning artifacts on other pages were obscured.  All pages were then subjected to a ""preflight"" image manipulation that increased page size from the scanned size of approximately 7.8 x 9"" (page sizes vary in the scan) to an 11 x 8.5 landscape format. The preflight also programmatically removed excess white space from the margins. The net effect is that the 594 content-bearing facsimile pages are easier to read and larger than their scanned progenitors. Because of a printer's limitation of no more than 400 pages for this trim size  the books were broken into two volumes  this first one containing the front matter and the navies of England  France  Germany  and Russia.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">The complete PDF was then passed through an ""AI"" text summarization tool which produced concise summaries of each page.

It was a success from the start and has become the standard reference directory on the topic. The Naval Warrant Officer's Journal suggested that the book be on every ship, and in 1902 said that it should be available to every naval officer. The Admiralty were less enthusiastic, partly due to Jane's irreverent behaviour - although some ships did acquire copies.",,,HIS027150,HISTORY / Military / Naval,,,,,Nimble Books LLC,1,,,,,"<p class=""ql-align-justify"">Ever since its first edition in 1898  Jane's&nbsp;<em>Fighting Ships</em>&nbsp;has been the go-to information source for navalists.

Flipping through&nbsp;<em>Jane's</em>&nbsp;for 1898 or 1906 or 1939  you are seeing through the eyes of history.

No hardcopy was available at the time of publication.&nbsp;Of the 604 pages in the scan  10 were considered so deficient that they should not be included.&nbsp;They were replaced with blank pages  and glaring scanning artifacts on other pages were obscured. All pages were then subjected to a ""preflight"" image manipulation that increased page size from the scanned size of approximately 7.8 x 9"" (page sizes vary in the scan) to an 11 x 8.5 landscape format. The preflight also programmatically removed excess white space from the margins. The net effect is that the 594 content-bearing facsimile pages are easier to read and larger than their scanned progenitors. Because of a printer's limitation of no more than 400 pages for this trim size  the books were broken into two volumes  this first one containing the front matter and the navies of England  France  Germany  and Russia.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">The complete PDF was then passed through an ""AI"" text summarization tool which produced concise summaries of each page.

The cause was an electrical malfunction that created a series of explosions. The high ambient temperature made the fire even more dangerous  and the lack of effective firefighting measures made it all but impossible to stop. The board of investigation that followed determined that no disciplinary action was warranted against any personnel. This thoroughly researched report tells the story of those who perished in the fire and their loved ones  as well as hinting at the struggles of the investigators who tried to learn what went wrong.</p>,<p>Aircraft carriers were vulnerable then and now.

The report is provided here with the addition of eight pages of analysis carried out by the AI Editorial Board at Nimble Books.</p><p><br></p><p>From the foreword to the original report:</p><p><br></p><p>As the U.S. Government's dedicated center for countering foreign disinformation and propaganda  the Global Engagement Center (GEC) at the U.S. Department of State has a mandate to expose and counter threats from malign actors that utilize these tactics. In this field  Russia continues to be a leading threat. The Department works with interagency and global partners to meet this challenge  with the GEC playing a key role in coordinating efforts and helping lead a global response.</p><p><br></p><p>A central part of this effort is exposing Russia's tactics so that partner and allied governments  civil society organizations  academia  the press  and the international public can conduct further analysis of their own and thereby increase collective resilience to disinformation and propaganda.</p><p><br></p><p>In line with that goal  this report draws on publicly available reporting to provide an overview of Russia's disinformation and propaganda ecosystem. Russia's disinformation and propaganda ecosystem is the collection of official  proxy  and unattributed communication channels and platforms that Russia uses to create and amplify false narratives. The ecosystem consists of five main pillars: official government communications  state-funded global messaging  cultivation of proxy sources  weaponization of social media  and cyber-enabled disinformation. The Kremlin bears direct responsibility for cultivating these tactics and platforms as part of its approach to using information as a weapon. It invests massively in its propaganda channels  its intelligence services and its proxies to conduct malicious cyber activity to support their disinformation eforts  and it leverages outlets that masquerade as news sites or research institutions to spread these false and misleading narratives. This report also focuses specific attention on Russia's tactic of leveraging proxy voices that proliferate pro-Kremlin disinformation and propaganda. It includes profiles on a cross section of outlets playing this role within the broader ecosystem  and it explains how they serve as critical connective tissue to the other pillars within the broader ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p>The AI contribution includes the following elements  all based on AI analysis of the content of the book:</p><ul><li>A Foreword written by Slava Suwarrow  the Nimble contributing editor responsible for books about Russia and the former Soviet Union;</li><li>A collection of alternate titles;</li><li>A collection of alternate back cover blurbs; </li><li>Automatically generated contents extracted from the text;</li><li>Automatically generated BISAC categories; and</li><li>a Bibliography.</li></ul><p>Because the large-language-model AI by its nature explores a larger probabilistic space than any human  the features listed above provide a variety of novel and interesting insights into the topic of Russian disinformation that are not available within the four corners of the report and would not be likely to occur to any single reader.</p><p><br></p>,,"Chossudovsky Global Research,Crimean Front,Culture Foundation article,disinformation,disinformation about Ukraine,Disinformation and Propaganda,Eastern Outlook,GEC,Global Engagement Center,Global Research,Mike Pompeo,propaganda,Russia,Russia Disinformation,Russian disinformation outlet,Russian intelligence services,Russian social media,Russian state media,SCF Russian authors,Site Profiles Global,Social Media Platforms,Southfront,SouthFront Global Research,Strategic Culture Foundation,Ukraine",Color 8.268 x 11.693 in or 297 x 210 mm (A4) Perfect Bound on 50 White w/Gloss Lam,84,Y,,,31-May-22,31-May-22,19.95,19.95,24.95,19.95,27.95,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,19.95,,19.95,19.95,19.95,19.95,19.95,19.95,19.95,19.95,30,,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

Born in Brazil, he started in the daily newspaper business in 1982 as a music, cinema, literature and cultural critic and became a foreign correspondent in 1985, first in London and then Milan, Los Angeles and Paris.

In 1994 he decided to move from the West to Asia, first to Singapore and then Bangkok and Hong Kong. He has been living between Europe and Asia ever since-with bases alternating between London/Paris and Bangkok/Hong Kong, as well as stints in Washington and New York.
He has covered virtually everything important that happened across Asia in the past 25 years, including the geopolitics and geoeconomics of Southeast Asia, China, Russia, and progressively, the arc from Afghanistan/Pakistan to Central Asia, Iran, Iraq, Turkey and the Persian Gulf.
Switching from the ""Asian miracle"" to the ""war on terror"", after 9/11 he covered the wars on Afghanistan and Iraq (before, during and after), energy wars and, in the Obama years, the American ""pivot"" to Asia. For the past few years, his focus is the Chinese-driven New Silk Roads, all aspects of Eurasia integration, and the geopolitical clash between the US and the Russia/China strategic partnership.
He has written columns and Op-Eds for dozens of online publications-including Al Jazeera, RT and Sputnik-and has been a frequent guest of TV and radio shows from North America to Asia. His articles/columns are regularly translated in several languages.

This volume includes 25 essays written for Asia Times  Consortium News  and Strategic Culture in the incomparable year of 2020 and adds a new introduction  afterword  and table of abbreviations. Educated people of all political persusasions will enjoy Escobar's stinging prose and his display of his wide-ranging and truly global knowledge of poetry  history  and political philosophy. American readers already skeptical of the dominant narrative will enjoy this scintillating dissection of the mammoth hypocrisy involved in the standard governmental and corporate narrative.  And those with perspectives similar to the American mainstream will benefit from reading a truly Other-centered exemplar of the several billion people who find the political perspectives that are commonplace in Asia  Europe  China  Russia  and Iran more congenial than those of a US establishment that has gifted the world with seventy-five-plus years of continuous war.  </p><p><br></p><p>Escobar's first book in the US   Globalistan (Nimble  2007)  brilliantly anticipated the future of a disintegrating international system in an era of ""Liquid"" (hybrid) war.

SEALS  naval aviators  submariners  yes  to be sure  they're all very dashing and very brave--but PT boat crews stood in shirtsleeves on the decks of wooden speedboats and sprinted under heavy fire toward enemy warships a hundred times their size. They didn't have Kevlar vests  they didn't have air superiority  and they didn't have stealth technology. They took great risks  in person  at the height of WWII  at the times and in the theaters where the risk of defeat was at its highest. PT Boats fought it out with the enemy under heavy fire  often at night  against warships  planes  barges  and shore installations.</p><p><br></p><p>For quite a long time  PT boats and PT boat sailors were incredibly famous.&nbsp;Douglas Macarthur was rescued from the Phillippines aboard a PT boat.&nbsp;The most decorated PT boat captain  Lieutenant John D. Bulkeley  was awarded the Medal of Honor. During the war years PT boat images were plastered on every conceivable type of marketing paraphernalia.&nbsp;Arguably the most handsome and charismatic US President ever  John F. Kennedy  was a PT boat captain and hero. His boat  PT 109  and crew were prominently featured in his 1960 election campaign. Had he survived to serve out two terms and live the full life he deserved  we would still be reading about PT 109. Such is the power and fickleness of myth.</p><p><br></p><p>The artifacts that Frank shares with readers do a wonderful job of conveying the feeling of time and place. Myths can and should rise again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This book includes 239 color images with detailed captions.&nbsp;There is a Foreword by PT boat sailor and World War II veteran Arthur John Frongello  Quartermaster Third Class  who served aboard PT 302 as a member of Squadron 22.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Author Frank J. Andruss  Sr. writes in the Preface:</p><p><br></p><p>My passion for the history of the PT boats began as a very young child  when  in 1967  my Dad suggested that I watch the movie PT 109. This started my life-long journey in which as a young twenty-year-old I had the pleasure of meeting so many PT boat veterans and started to collect some of these treasured artifacts of the PT Navy. Over the years I would begin to create ""The Mosquito Fleet Exhibit"" in which I would use these artifacts to tell the story and provide the history that so many people did not know about.</p><p><br></p><p>It is my hope that  through these artifacts that were such a large part of PT history  this book brings new attention to the PT navy during World War II. In this book I hope to tell the stories of the brave sailors that served on the boats. PT boats played important roles from the first days of the war. They were in the Philippines  at Guadalcanal  at New Guinea  in the Med  at Surigao Strait. Their crews deserve to be remembered when World War II history is told. Although the PT boat has long since gone  the bravery of the men who rode on her decks should never be forgotten.</p>",,"candy box collecting,candy collecting,motor torpedo boat,mtb,navy memorabilia,patrol torpedo boat,pin collecting,pt boat,torpedo,torpedo boat",Color 8 x 10 in or 254 x 203 mm Case Laminate on 50 White w/Matte Lam,172,Y,,,15-Dec-20,15-Dec-20,37.99,28.99,47.99,34.99,50.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,37.99,,34.95,37.99,37.99,37.99,34.95,34.95,37.99,37.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

In this context  <em>deep space </em>is anything beyond geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO).

The first assumption is that growing international activity  commerce  and industry in space extends the global commons  thus creating a military-economic imperative for the United States Department of Defense (DoD) to expand its protection of U.S. interests by defending space lines of communication. Although there are wide-ranging reasons to expand the space-faring capabilities of the human species  from the capitalistic to the existential  the fact of its occurrence offers the U.S. immense strategic opportunity.

Specifically  this study seeks to answer the question  ""What is the nature of spacepower?"" It also test the aerospace integration school's hypothesis that spacepower is simply a continuation or extension of airpower. Two points come immediately to the forefront of this work. First  spacepower is different from airpower even though both share the vertical dimension of warfare. Second  space operations have matured to a point where valid and unique propositions regarding spacepower are identifiable. The ten propositions presented here do not represent a complete list. The method used to derive these propositions involved literary research that result in a long list. The list evolved over three years during numerous brainstorming with several space experts--most of them space weapons officers with theater and often combat experience--until the list was carefully refined into the ten most salient propositions. There were many ways to present the Ten Propositions Regarding Spacepower  but the author deferred to Meininger's approach of citing each proposition as a thesis statement with supporting material immediately following. The objective of this work is to stimulate discussions and help those who do not yet understand or appreciate the nature of spacepower in modern warfare.</p>",,"space,space force,space power,united states space force,ussf",B&W 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Case Laminate on White w/Matte Lam,156,Y,,,17-Nov-20,17-Nov-20,21.99,16.99,26.99,19.99,28.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,21.99,,19.95,21.99,21.99,21.99,19.95,19.95,21.99,21.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

As the author explains in the Abstract:</p><p><br></p><p>In 2008  the Independent Assessment Panel on the Organization and Management of National Security Space (NSS) reported to Congress that the military and intelligence space programs are fragmented  disorganized  inefficient  and ineffective. Without strong leadership and a unifying vision  the United State (US) space enterprise is losing its advantage over competing nations. The nation must address this erosion of capability with vigor in the near term. Inaction threatens US national interests. The US should create a separate military Department of the Space Force.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This work begins with a summary of the current strategic space environment  examines the fragmented state of the existing space enterprise  and establishes a framework for evaluating NSS. Having established the current NSS environment  it examines the genesis of the US Air Force (USAF). Air and airpower possess a set of specific characteristics that justify a distinct military service. This work then evaluates space and spacepower using the same series of attributes that validate a separate Air Force. Based on these attributes  the unique characteristics of space and space forces require the creation of a new Space Force. This work offers an organizational evolution for the current US space enterprise to address the significant issues that threaten the nation's ability to achieve national objectives. This necessary evolution is a Department of the Space Force.</p><p><br></p><p>This reproduction is printed with full color interior and a handsome  durable case laminate matte exterior.

Attention at Los Alamos at the time was focused on implosion-type warheads because gun-type warheads made inefficient use of fissionable materials  so the Bureau of Ordnance was asked to take the lead in initial studies before work moved to Sandia. The military asked the bomb designers to focus on gun-type warheads for several major missions: delivery via subsonic and supersonic aircraft; via cruise missile; and via guided missile. They were asked to ensure that the warhead would detonate successfully after penetrating water  earth  rock  and thin steel. An extensive testing program gave confidence that this could be achieved with gun-type warheads. There was some resistance to the the requirement for penetrating solid rock--a mission that in the modern era has become of paramount importance.</p><p><br></p><p>If the Mk 8 and its successor the Mk 11 had ever been used in anger  it would most likely have been in the context of a global nuclear war in the 1950s  perhaps beginning during the Korean War  delivered against targets on the periphery of the Soviet Union or against the People's Republic of China.

The largely unredacted report includes a timetable of weapon events; a history of the Mk 25; a glossary of terms; and references with 57 endnotes. It tells a fascinating story.</p><p><br></p><p>The military requirements were driven by the potential of saturation attacks by mass formations of Soviet bombers and guided missiles that would in turn require defense of most of the perimeter of North America. ""It was predicted that that air defense weapons would have to be produced in large numbers  possibly tens of thousands  in order to provide an effective defense of any sizable portion of the country. They would thus have to be economical  both in nuclear and nonnuclear costs. These weapons would have to be operationally ready at all times to respond to a surprise attack  and they would have to be able to withstand exposure to climatic extremes ranging from the arctic to the tropics. The weapons should require only minor maintenance  since it would not be possible to provide a sufficiently large group of thoroughly trained technicians."" </p><p><br></p><p>The result of this analysis was the development beginning in 1954 of the Mk 25 air defense warhead.  Beginning in 1957 the Mk 25 was deployed on the GENIE unguided air-to-air missile launched by F-89 and F-102 interceptors. The optimum yield was calculated by still-classified methods that involved tradeoffs between the probability of kill  the weight of the missile and aircraft  efficiency in the use of nuclear materials  and the time needed for the launch aircraft to escape.  The Mk 25 and its successors were deployed on US and Canadian NORAD interceptors until the early 1980s.</p><p><br></p><p>To demonstrate that air defense nuclear weapons could be used without harm to the civilian population  the Air Force conducted a special demonstration during the John shot of the Operation Plumbob test series in 1957.  Five Air Force officers volunteered to stand  hatless  directly underneath ground zero of the 1.5 kt airburst. Video of them afterwards shows them shaking hands and lighting cigars.  Fun!  One can only imagine how much fun the civilian population of North America would have had watching Mk 25s light up the skies over cities such as Seattle  Winnipeg  Minneapolis  Detroit  Buffalo  and Boston.</p><p><br></p><p>Readers who enjoy content like DR.

It finds that changes in the military space organizations  capabilities  and policies of these three allies since 2008 have significantly increased the ability of their militaries to collaborate fruitfully with the Department of Defense. Furthermore  aided by the ongoing growth of their military space cadres  collaboration with these countries can expand from a traditional focus on technical applications into combined education  doctrine  and policy. The thesis closes on a cautionary note  arguing that the Department of Defense needs to carefully consider how it will develop trust with foreign spacefaring militaries  with the Department of Commerce likely to assume responsibility for the foreign engagement associated with the United States' space situational awareness data-sharing agreements by 2024.""</p><p><br></p>",,"australia satellites,australia space,coalition,five eyes,france military,france space,isr,japan satellites,japan space,space,space force",B&W 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Case Laminate on White w/Matte Lam,124,Y,,,10-Nov-20,10-Nov-20,21.99,16.99,26.99,19.99,28.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,21.99,,19.95,21.99,21.99,21.99,19.95,19.95,21.99,21.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

It provides a basic summary of facts about the manuscript and its provenance and adds a survey of proposed solutions  most of which it dispenses with quite quickly. I found it interesting to discover that Tiltman was first introduced to the Voynich ms. by William Friedman  founder of the NSA  in 1947 (!)  I was also intrigued that Tiltman's scholarly research into the history of medieval herbalism included consultations with leading English academics  no doubt during visits on ""Five Eyes"" business.</p><p><br></p><p>The second essay  originally classifed Top Secret Umbra  is ""An Application of PTAH to the Voynich Manuscript"" by Mary D'Imperio - the title itself was unclassified.   A few pages in  I came to a full stop when I encountered this:</p><p><br></p><p> ""PTAH (named for the Egyptian god of wisdom)  is a general statistical method developed at IDA (Institute for Defense Analyses)  Princeton University.  PTAH got its name when a programmer. Mr.Gerry Mitchell  was listening to the opera ""Aida"" while working on his program. He was struck by the passage ""immenso Ptah noi invociam "" and named his program after the Egyptian god. The name was ultimately extended from this program  implementing a particular application of the method  to the method and its mathematical theory as well...""</p><p> </p><p> The technical meaning of PTAH remains classified  although Google helped me find a journal article that suggests PTAH must be some sort of Hidden Markov Model. (Math. Comput. Appl. 2019  24  14; doi:10.3390/mca24010014)</p><p><br></p><p> D'Imperio used PTAH to analyze the Voynich manuscript and similar works and concluded that ""I find the above comparisions quite convincing support for a view that the Voynich text  regarded as a string of single letters  does not 'act like' natural language. Instead  it exhibits a clear positional regularity or characters within words. I believe that these findings strengthen the theory of Friedman and Tiltman that an artificial language may underlie the Yoynich text.""</p><p><br></p><p> Government interest dating back to 1947 ... pharmacology unknown to modern man ... artificial languages ... the movie ""ARRIVAL"" based on Ted Chiang's ""Story of Your Life"" ...  hmmm ...</p><p><br></p><p>The third essay  also by D'Imperio  is ""An Application of Cluster Analysis and Multidimensional Scaling to the Question of 'Hands' and 'Languages' in the Voynich Manuscript."" She uses cluster analytic techniques to examine findings by Captain Prescott Currier  who suggested that the manuscript's pages can be clustered into groups of multiple authors and styles.  D'Imperio's discussion includes warnings that are still sound today: "" The interpretation of cluster analysis results is unavoidably circular; we propose a certain structure in the group of objects under study  we perform the computation  and we are happy if we see what we expected  or at least something that makes sense in terms of our original hypothesis  however revised.""</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth and final essay  by James Child  takes an important step forward by proposing that ""the Voynich Manuscript does not contain an artificial language nor the enciphered text of an underlying text in an unknown language. but is a text in a hitherto unknown medieval North Germanic dialect.""</p><p><br></p><p>People who enjoy works like THE DA VINCI CODE  PUZZLE PALACE  and Snowden will find this fascinating.</p><p><br></p>",,"antiquities,cryptography,da vinci code,dan brown,manuscripts,medieval,national security agency,nsa,snowden,voynich",B&W 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Case Laminate on White w/Matte Lam,96,Y,,,27-Oct-20,27-Oct-20,21.99,16.99,26.99,19.99,28.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,21.99,,19.95,21.99,21.99,21.99,19.95,19.95,21.99,21.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

History of Gun-Type Artillery-Fired Atomic Projectiles,9.78161E+12,1608881784,Available for Printing/Download,Case Laminate,ENG,,,,0,Sandia National Laboratories,,,Author,,,,,,HIS027030,HISTORY / Military / Nuclear Warfare,,,,,Nimble Books LLC,1,,,,,"<p>The marketplace for books about military history is crowded with an abundance of titles about every weapon system ever built  from trireme to Tiger tank  but  ironically  is almost deserted when it comes to the most fearsome weapons of all: the never-used nuclear weapons of the Cold War. That gap is partly filled by this never previously published series of declassified official histories written by Sandia National Laboratories in the late 1960s.</p><p><br></p><p>This volume is a history of the gun-type artillery-fired atomic projectiles that entered service beginning in 1952 with the Mk 9 and followed by Mks 19  23  32  and 33. The work contains a timeline; a narrative history; a glossary of terms; and 58 footnotes.  </p><p><br></p><p>Development began in late 1949 (shortly after the first Soviet detonation of an atomic weapon) at the request of the Army.  Sandia defines the weapon's mission as ""a defensive or offensive weapon against infantry masses concentrated in front of the sector through which a breakthrough was planned. It was hoped that a nuclear artillery shell  fuzed for air burst  could destroy the ability of these troops to stage an attack  or defend the sector.""  It's noteworthy that the weapon was not expected to be used against the Soviet Union's primary land striking force  its tens of thousands of tanks in armored formations.  </p><p><br></p><p>The initial design was for a 890-lb shell that could be fired from a 280-mm gun at muzzle velocity of 1700 feet per second.  This was heavier and slower than a conventional shell and meant that special propellant charges  firing tables  and spotting shells were required in operation.  Prototype shells were being fired by mid-1951  and the the Mk 9 Mod 0-ZZ Shell was successfully tested in Operation Upshot-Knothole at the Nevada Test Site in Shot Grable on May 23  1953.  Yield was the expected 15 kilotons.  </p><p><br></p><p>The Mk 9 was replaced  by the Mk 19  which was the same weight as a conventional shell and thus could be operated under normal firing procedures.</p><p><br></p><p>The Mk 23 shell was developed to be fired from the 16-inch (405-mm) rifles on board US Navy battleships with an amphibious warfare rather than antiship mission in mind.  Initial deliveries were made to the Fleet in the same period as the Navy retired the last 16-inch rifle from active use.  </p><p><br></p><p>The TX-32 shell was intended for use in the 240-mm howitzer  but was cancelled in favor of an 8-inch (203-mm) implosion design proposed by the University of California Radiation Laboratory.  The Mk 33 shell was available by July 1955 for the 8-inch M-2 howitzer.</p><p><br></p><p>Fortunate indeed that the history of these particular weapons is not written in fire on the pages of history. In another world  this might be the story of the Mk 9 that was fired from ""Atomic Annie"" against the 5th Guards Banner Army at the Rhine  or the Katie that was fired from the battleship New Jersey to support the amphibious assault on Shanghai.</p>",,"artillery,atomic weapons,battleships,cold war,nuclear weapons,warfare",B&W 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Case Laminate on White w/Matte Lam,40,Y,,,27-Oct-20,27-Oct-20,17.99,13.99,21.99,15.99,22.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,17.99,,15.95,17.99,17.99,17.99,15.95,15.95,17.99,17.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

Commandant's Planning Guidance: 38th Commandant of the Marine Corps,9.78161E+12,1608881474,Available for Printing/Download,Case Laminate,ENG,,,,0,"Berger, General David H.",,,Author,,,,,,HIS027150,HISTORY / Military / Naval,HIS027060,HISTORY / Military / Strategy,,,Nimble Books LLC,1,,,,,"<p>The Commandant's Planning Guidance (CPG) provides the 38th Commandant's strategic direction for the Marine Corps and mirrors the function of the Secretary of Defense's Defense Planning Guidance (DPG). It serves as the authoritative document for Service-level planning and provides a common direction to the Marine Corps Total Force. It also serves as a road map describing where the Marine Corps is going and why; what the Marine Corps force development priorities are and are not; and  in some instances  how and when prescribed actions will be implemented. This CPG serves as my Commandant's Intent for the next four years.</p><p><br></p><p>As Commandant Neller observed  ""The Marine Corps is not organized  trained  equipped  or postured to meet the demands of the rapidly evolving future operating environment."" I concur with his diagnosis. Significant change is required to ensure we are aligned with the 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) and DPG  and further  prepared to meet the demands of the Naval Fleet in executing current and emerging operational naval concepts. Effecting that change will be my top priority as your 38th Commandant.</p><p><br></p><p>This CPG outlines my five priority focus areas: force design  warfighting  education and training  core values  and command and leadership. I will use these focal areas as logical lines of effort to frame my thinking  planning  and decision-making at Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC)  as well as to communicate to our civilian leadership. This document explains how we will translate those focus areas into action with measurable outcomes. The institutional changes that follow this CPG will be based on a long-term view and singular focus on where we want the Marine Corps to be in the next 5-15 years  well beyond the tenure of any one Commandant  Presidential administration  or Congress. We cannot afford to retain outdated policies  doctrine  organizations  or force development strategies.</p><p><br></p><p>The coming decade will be characterized by conflict  crisis  and rapid change - just as every decade preceding it. And despite our best efforts  history demonstrates that we will fail to accurately predict every conflict; will be surprised by an unforeseen crisis; and may be late to fully grasp the implications of rapid change around us. The Arab Spring  West African Ebola Outbreak  Scarborough Shoal standoff  Russian invasion of eastern Ukraine  and weaponization of social media are but a few recent examples illustrating the point. While we must accept an environment characterized by uncertainty  we cannot ignore strong signals of change nor be complacent when it comes to designing and preparing the force for the future.</p><p><br></p><p>What is abundantly clear is that the future operating environment will place heavy demands on our Nation's Naval Services. Context and direction is clearly articulated in the NDS and DPG as well as testimony from our uniformed and civilian leadership. No further guidance is required; we are moving forward. The Marine Corps will be trained and equipped as a naval expeditionary force-in-readiness and prepared to operate inside actively contested maritime spaces in support of fleet operations. In crisis prevention and crisis response  the Fleet Marine Force - acting as an extension of the Fleet - will be first on the scene  first to help  first to contain a brewing crisis  and first to fight if required to do so. The Marine Corps will be the ""force of choice"" for the President  Secretary  and Combatant Commander - ""a certain force for an uncertain world"" as noted by Commandant Krulak. No matter what the crisis  our civilian leaders should always have one shared thought - Send in the Marines.</p>",,"china,cruise missiles,marine corps,naval history,navy,strategy,warfare",Color 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Case Laminate on 50 White w/Matte Lam,28,Y,,,8-Oct-20,8-Oct-20,15.99,11.99,20.99,14.99,21.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,15.99,,14.99,15.99,15.99,15.99,14.99,14.99,15.99,15.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

This publication answers why spacepower is vital for our&nbsp;Nation  how military spacepower is employed  who military space&nbsp;forces are  and what military space forces value. In short  this capstone&nbsp;document is the foundation of our professional body of knowledge as&nbsp;we forge an independent military Service committed to space operations.&nbsp;Like all doctrine  the SCP remains subject to the policies and&nbsp;strategies that govern its employment. Military spacepower has deterrent&nbsp;and coercive capacities - it provides independent options for&nbsp;National and Joint leadership but achieves its greatest potential when&nbsp;integrated with other forms of military power. As we grow spacepower&nbsp;theory and doctrine  we must do so in a way that fosters greater&nbsp;integration with the Air Force  Army  Navy  Marine Corps  and Coast&nbsp;Guard. It is only by achieving true integration and interdependence&nbsp;that we can hope to unlock spacepower's full potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Agility  innovation  and boldness have always been the touchstone&nbsp;traits of military space forces. Today  we must harness these traits to&nbsp;pioneer a new Service and a new professional body of knowledge.&nbsp;This capstone doctrine is a point-of-departure toward that goal  not a&nbsp;final adjudication. Given the nascent state of spacepower theory  this&nbsp;publication will inevitably evolve over time as it is applied  evaluated &nbsp;and refined. Therefore  military space forces are encouraged to read &nbsp;critique  debate  and improve upon the ideas that follow.</p>,,"space,space power,spacepower",Color 5.5 x 8.5 in or 216 x 140 mm (Demy 8vo) Case Laminate on 50 White w/Matte Lam,80,,,,10-Aug-20,10-Aug-20,21.99,16.99,26.99,19.99,28.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,21.99,,19.99,21.99,21.99,21.99,19.99,19.99,21.99,21.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

A cabal of generals took the nation&#39;s reins and bungled their way toward an accommodation with the Allies. When General Eisenhower announced an armistice with Italy on the evening of 8 September he believed he had struck a deal that included Italian military cooperation against the Germans. In fact  the generals had promised more than they could deliver and Germany&#39;s terrible  swift reprisal shattered Italy&#39;s confused air force and army. The armistice likewise caught the navy by surprise  with its battleships raising steam to attack the Allied fleet landing at Salerno. Nonetheless  the Regia Marina obeyed its government&#39;s orders and honored the pact the generals had negotiated. Rather than evaporating like Italy&#39;s other services  however  it proceeded to fight a three-week campaign against Germany  without Allied support  and in the process retained complete control of its ships  regardless of the ports necessity forced them to seek refuge in.</p><p>This is the story of the Regia Marina and the Italian armistice of September 1943. It is a deeply-researched and highly readable exploration of this confusing and fascinating corner of history. It refutes the conventional notion that Italy&#39;s fleet abjectly surrendered to Allied power. It shows how the navy paved Italy&#39;s path from enemy to co-belligerent with the blood and unconquered spirit of its men. Despite German and Allied intentions to secure Italy&#39;s fleet for their own uses  it remained Italian to the end: a dark navy - not victorious  but undefeated.</p><p>Vincent P.

Among them are those who courageously face repeated hospitalizations  surgeries  feeding tubes  dialysis  EEGs  respiration and heart monitors  and a life-time of therapy. Lexie has a medical condition that requires her to spend a lot of time in therapy  at hospitals  and in doctors&#39; offices. She knows first-hand just how difficult  painful  and scary  these experiences can be. &quot;Be brave and know that you are not alone&quot; is Lexie&#39;s message  as she encourages young children who face these challenges in Brave Just Like Me.</p><p>Brave Just Like Me was inspired by a three year old girl named Lexie  who was born with a life threatening medical condition. One day  shortly after Lexie returned home from her second kidney transplant surgery  her mother held her in her arms while she slept. It was a day like many others  but as her mother gazed in deepest admiration on her brave little girl  the words to this book were born - not in a slow or uncertain trickle but in strong  overpowering waves. So compelling was this experience  that Lexie&#39;s mother laid her sleeping child in bed to capture these words in writing. Inspired by love and a deep desire to acknowledge  comfort  and encourage children who face the same hardships her daughter experiences  Kimberly wrote her first children&#39;s book.</p><p>It was only a matter of days before this first time author found an illustrator  who not only offered but insisted on painting the illustrations for the book and donating the artwork. Stacy spent years painting for the book  as her schedule allowed  and through many personal challenges. Through Stacy  Kimberly found Leslie  a graphic design artist who helped finish the illustrations and set words to art  again donating her work to the cause  despite her own personal hardships. The book moved from Stacy  to Leslie  to Aaron  who volunteered to scan the artwork into print ready files. The book then found its way to a publisher  who not only believed enough in the book to publish it  but valued an affordable price point over profit to ensure the book reached those who needed it most. So  really  Brave Just Like Me has two stories to tell - one about a brave little girl and one about the kindness and goodness of people.</p><p>Each person who has touched this book wants only one thing from this endeavor - to comfort and encourage young children who are working courageously to overcome the pain and disabilities that often accompany serious and life threatening medical conditions. &quot;It is our sincerest hope that Brave Just Like Me finds its way into the hands of these precious children. We would encourage anyone who purchases this book for a loved one to also consider donating a copy to a local children&#39;s hospital  pediatrician  therapist  or Ronald McDonald House.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>This special keepsake edition of Brave Just Like Me includes an opening page where young readers can record their names. The author has included a list of questions at the end of the story that will help parents and educators explore anxieties and fears surrounding the medical experiences children endure  to help them identify strategies for coping  and to carve out opportunities for celebrating their courage and strength. This book contains several keepsake pages where the child can collect pictures  signatures  and well wishes from doctors  nurses  family  and friends who have helped them through their medical journey. It is the author and the publisher&rsquo;s sincerest hope that these keepsake pages will inspire children with serious medical conditions to someday share their story.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>,,"childhood illness,hospitalization",Premium Color 8 x 10 in or 254 x 203 mm Case Laminate on White w/Gloss Lam,38,,N,,21-Jul-20,21-Jul-20,21.99,16.99,26.99,19.99,28.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,21.99,,20.95,21.99,21.99,21.99,20.95,20.95,21.99,21.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

Far from ""being made obsolete in a single day""  Lundgren upends the conventional wisdom by showing that the battle line was an essential tool for the exercise of seapower all the way to V-J Day.    Indeed  he argues  the Japanese Navy's undue reliance on aircraft carriers alone was a key factor in its loss of command of the sea.   From the introduction: ""Human perception is human reality and I offer a different perspective on battleships by applying the principles of several naval and military thinkers  including Alfred Thayer Mahan and Julian Corbett that may change the perception that battleships became obsolete? By the end of the World War Two the aircraft carrier had replaced the battleship as the reigning queen of the seas. No new battleships designs were created leaving the last four Iowa class battleships to be the last of their kind to serve the United States. What role did battleships  aircraft carriers  cruisers  and submarines play in the United States victory and Japan's defeat during the Second World War? I will argue here that  contrary to conventional wisdom  battleships continued to play a decisive role throughout the war.""  Through a meticulous examination of the operational details of every major battle in the War in the Pacific  Lundgren illuminates how the US prevailed with a ""combined arms"" approach that made use of all the particular capabilities of aircraft carriers  battleships  and submarines.  Only in this way could a navy follow the fundamental principles of sea power identified by Mahan and Corbett.   This is a must read for anyone who thinks they know the history of the War in the Pacific.  A wonderful gift that will spark many debates among battleship and naval aviation enthusiasts alike.

Even though they cover topics ranging from history  to politics  to religion  to military affairs  to social issues  they are all linked by one common thread: the full-spectrum clash between the Western world and what the Saker calls the ""Russian civilizational realm"". Most Russians  especially when addressing a western audience  feel compelled to use a diplomatic and non-confrontational language. In contrast  Saker's style is informal  almost conversational  but also direct  even blunt. He is fully aware that his views might offend many of his readers  but he believes that there is also a bigger audience out there which will appreciate an honest and  above all  sincere criticism of what the Saker calls the ""AngloZionist Empire"". The careful reader  however  will notice that the Saker's criticisms are always aimed at a political system and its constituent institutions and supporting ideologies  but never at the people  nations or ethnicities.  In fact  the Saker forcefully argues for a multi-cultural  multi-ethnic and multi-religious Russia which would be fully integrated in a multi-polar world inspired by the fraternal diversity of the BRICS countries. Underlying the Saker's entire worldview is a categorical rejection of all ideologies and a profound belief that the root of all evil as well as the key to defeating it is always in the realm of spirituality.</p><p>Gilad Atzmon  jazz musician and philosopher:</p><blockquote><p>As telling the truth is becoming a nostalgic endeavour  its seeking is becoming an heroic adventure.

The foreword is by a renowned professor of Geopolitics of the Hellenic Military Academy  Dr Constantinos Grivas. The Russians fought on the side of the breakaway Republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in a war  which is also known as ""The Five Day War"". There is an extensive analysis on the diplomatic prelude occurring prior to the beginning of the hostilities  debating the causes that led Georgia to attack the breakaways and Russia to defend them. The prelude covers deep historical topics since the fall of the Soviet Union and the subsequent rise of Gamsakhurdia  the nationalist Georgian leader  Eduard Shevardnadze  whose toppling by the Rose Revolution brought Mikhail Saakashvili to power. Military operations are described and analyzed thoroughly starting from the skirmishes between Georgians and Ossetians and culminating with the war's most decisive battle  the battle of Tskhinvali. The essay sheds light on the new Russian military doctrine and the reforms  which took place in the Russian Army  following the Five Day War  in all sectors including the Army   VDV troops  the Air Force and the Navy. Finally  an extensive analysis is carried out both in the framework of geoeconomics and that of international relations and geopolitics  around Russia's future diplomatic ties with the EU and the US  separately  including the recent events in the US and European Economies  which have led to the manifestation of a European power centralized around Germany.  The battle of Tskhinvali may well have settled the fate of the Caucasus for the 21st century  and foreshadowed the campaigns in Crimea  Ukraine  and beyond.",,,Color 6 x 9 in or 229 x 152 mm Case Laminate on 50 White w/Matte Lam,116,,N,,8-Aug-15,8-Aug-15,21.99,16.99,26.99,19.99,28.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,21.99,,19.95,21.99,21.99,21.99,19.95,19.95,21.99,21.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

The IJN succeeded  after many studies and false starts  in creating the world's most heavily armed (nine 18.1"" main guns in three triple turrets - the largest calibre ever mounted) and protected (410-mm thick VH belt armor  660-mm thick front shields of the gun houses - the thickest armour plates ever mounted) battleships. With a displacement in excess of 70 000 tons their size was unprecedented but despite this restrictions resulted in defects  which otherwise might have been avoided; other defects were the result of techniques below the highest standard.  Because the qualities of a battleship were generally measured by gun power  protection and mobility the authors have focused upon these items after giving a rough outline of the design and building processes. The result is probably the most detailed description based upon Japanese sources published outside Japan.  Stimulated by Gustav Jensen's expanded dissertation Japans Seemacht and encouraged by Messrs. Erich Gr�ner and Prof. J�rgen Rohwer  Hans Lengerer began writing on the IJN in 1969. Over the years more than 50 articles have appeared in magazines like Marine Rundschau  Marine Forum  Warship and Interconair Aviation e Marina. After retirement from service in an executive organ  Lengerer continues to write books and articles using a considerable amount of time for his hobby. He is also the author of the privately published Contributions to the History of Imperial Japanese Warships  referred to in this book  and is presently working to revise and condense his 250 000-word manuscript Development of Warship Construction in Japan and to complete A History of the Imperial Japanese Navy. As ""hobby researcher"" at best  his writings depend heavily upon information supplied by other IJN fans; they come first therefore.

He has written monographs about the IJN battleships of the Nagato class and the IJN aircraft carrier Taih�. His articles have appeared in Sveriges Flotta  Warship International and Okrety Wojenne and for several years he has been the editor of Contributions to the History of Imperial Japanese Warships.

Currently  the U.S. Navy relies on a shrinking group of aging Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates to conduct counterpiracy  counter-narcotics  counter maritime insurgency  and maritime engagement missions. The large warships that make up the rest of the fleet are able to undertake these missions  but their cost and capabilities make them better suited for other operations. This thesis examines the proposed Littoral Combat Ship but argues that it is not the ideal ship: it is too expensive  too vulnerable  and undermanned  and it has a modular concept that is too underdeveloped for practical naval operations. Instead  this thesis proposes that the U.S. Navy would be better served by procuring a traditional frigate or corvette to accomplish the variety of missions that fall under the umbrella of homeland defense. Such a traditional small combatant would provide the U.S. Navy with a warship capable of conducting traditional fleet operations as well as operating at the lower end of the spectrum of operations,,,B&W 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Case Laminate on White w/Matte Lam,104,,N,,7-Jun-13,7-Jun-13,16.99,12.99,20.99,14.99,21.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,16.99,,15,16.99,16.99,16.99,15,15,16.99,16.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

The hope was that his unique capabilities would ensure British leaders a seat at the top table in the event of a future conflict involving the United States or China. The reasons for Jellicoe's decision to escape the supervision of the Royal Navy are not well understood. </p><p>Jellicoe likes to embellish his work with epigraphs from naval history.

A general model of laser weapons is established to identify the attributes that characterize the laser weapon system. Quantitative values of each attribute are compared with current laser systems (that are under development) to identify potential laser types for employment on the Navy ship. In addition  plausible operational scenarios of suicide attacks by multiple (up to three) small and fast motor boats equipped with Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) against LCS-class ships are drawn up. These provide input parameters for computation of the required laser parameters to neutralize such threats. Based on the chosen laser technology and the calculated laser parameters  the requirements for employment of the laser weapon system on a Navy ship are determined.,,,B&W 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Case Laminate on White w/Matte Lam,88,,N,,7-May-13,7-May-13,17.99,13.99,21.99,15.99,22.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,17.99,,16,17.99,17.99,17.99,16,16,17.99,17.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

It resonates with famous names like Midway  Bismarck  Guadalcanal  and the Battle of the Atlantic. This collection of articles previously published in national magazines including World War II  Tin Can Sailor  and Pacific War explores some less famous episodes in the naval war including naval actions fought in the Indian Ocean  the Mediterranean  the South China Sea  and the English Channel  between the naval forces of France  Thailand  Italy  Poland  Germany  Japan  and of course  the U.S. and Royal navies. <p>The Royal Navy's Revenge includes the title action  the last surface battle of the war between British destroyers and a former nemesis of the Royal Navy  the Japanese heavy cruiser Haguro. The story of the U.S. Navy's first surface action against the Japanese  a victory won off the coast of Borneo by four World War I era destroyers is included.  The book also contains self-contained and fast-paced accounts of naval actions fought between Italy and Germany  France and Great Britain  and the Battle of Koh-Chang  between France and Thailand.  It also has an account of a mystery battle between German and American destroyers that has escaped the notice of historians until recently  the story of the defiant German flotilla that held out in the English Channel until the very end of the war and the little known naval campaign fought off the coast of Syria between Vichy France and naval forces from Great Britain  Australia  and New Zealand. <p>These fascinating and well researched episodes by the respected naval historian Vincent P. O'Hara will entertain and educate even the most  well-studied World War II enthusiast.,,,Color 7 x 10 in or 254 x 178 mm Case Laminate on 50 White w/Matte Lam,124,,N,,30-Apr-13,30-Apr-13,27.99,20.99,33.99,24.99,36.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,27.99,,25,27.99,27.99,27.99,25,25,27.99,27.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

This thesis suggests what existingcommercially available UUV system architectural attributes could be used now in U.S. Navy applications. After a survey of multiple existing commercial UUV systems  five of the prevalent systems in the marketplace were selected for analysis and comparison of their system architecture. This thesis included a comprehensive architectural analysis on seven specific architectural attributes of these UUV systems. Other UUV systems were also analyzed to support specific system architecture discussion. Major architecture considerations were made by the UUV system designers and likely drivers of existing system attributes were discussed as well as the benefits and disadvantages of these system attributes. Finally  based on the material and findings of the thesis  recommendations for a notional UUV system design and architecture for the U.S. Navy was presented.,,,Color 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Case Laminate on 50 White w/Matte Lam,150,,N,,26-Apr-13,15-May-13,25.99,19.99,32.99,23.99,34.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,25.99,,23.99,25.99,25.99,25.99,23.99,23.99,25.99,25.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

Re-Reading Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,9.78161E+12,1608881385,Available for Printing/Download,Case Laminate,ENG,,,,0,"Davis, Graeme",,,Author,,,,,,FIC009000,FICTION / Fantasy / General,,,,,Nimble Books LLC,,,,,,Re-reading 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' provides an insightful commentary which takes readers through the novel. It looks at such areas as literary quality  character analysis and plot analysis  while showing that the novel is contextualised within the British culture which informs it. There's plenty for Harry Potter fans in its attention to detail and examination of theories  plot holes and more. J K Rowling's excellence as a writer is explored alongside her occasional shortcomings. Structured in a fun and lighthearted manner  the book gives each chapter a start rating  and assessment includes a look at the heroes and villains in each. Yet it is also a step towards serious literary criticism of the novel  based on the view that the Harry Potter stories should be treated as quality literature.<P>This book is presented to those re-reading Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows as a prompt for serious consideration of the novel as a work of literature. Inevitably you will agree with much and disagree with much that is written here - that is the nature of literary criticism - but the process of agreeing and disagreeing develops a more considered critical response. Certainly literary criticism is needed. For a book which has received the massive sales of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (15 000 000 copies in the first twenty-four hours alone) there has so far been amazingly little proper criticism published. This book may be regarded as an early contribution to the literary criticism of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.<P>Demonstrating that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a polished work by a highly skilled writer  this book suggests that it can stand alongside established works of literature. It offers to adult readers as much as it does to the young adults and children that were its first audience  and as such it has the potential to become a true literary classic. The novel's position in global culture is set out and the moral values of the novel are explored  including Harry's role as a Christian hero. Re-reading 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' aims to develop your appreciation of a remarkable novel.<P>,,,B&W 5.5 x 8.5 in or 216 x 140 mm (Demy 8vo) Case Laminate on White w/Matte Lam,166,,N,,30-Jun-12,3-May-13,17.99,13.99,21.99,15.99,23.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,17.99,,16.32,17.99,17.99,17.99,16.32,16.32,17.99,17.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

That erroneous conclusion which  by default  has become the Navy's explanation for the tragedy  contributed to the conspiracy theory that SCORPION was sunk by a Soviet torpedo.<p>This book includes six letters sent to the Navy from 2009 to 2011.  These letters provide the results of the first reanalysis in 40 yeears of acoustic detections of the loss of SCORPION.  This reanalysis confirms the 1970 SAG battery-explosion assessment and provides important new information on the loss of SCORPION.<p>The author was the lead acoustic analyst at the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) for 42 years  ending in 2007.  ONI did not receive any SCORPION acoustic data until the author provided it in October 2009.<p>The book includes a prologue signed by 96 members of the Scorpion families asking the Navy to bring forth further information on the causes of the tragedy.<p>",,,Premium Color 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Case Laminate on White w/Matte Lam,74,,N,,31-Oct-11,1-Nov-11,34.95,23.99,40.99,28.99,42.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,34.95,,34.95,34.95,34.95,34.95,34.95,34.95,34.95,34.95,40,,40,40,40,40,40,40,40,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

Rising Storm: Battle of the Atlantic 1939-1940 (Naval Wargaming Rules),9.78161E+12,1608881032,Title has expired,Perfect Bound,ENG,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Nimble Books LLC,,,,,,From the introduction to these naval wargaming rules:<p>Immediately on the declaration of hostilities in September 1939 the British Admiralty was ready to convoy merchant shipping. They had learnt a lot during 1917-18 and the movement of ships by convoy was something used in war over past centuries. Pre-War it was part of the examination for merchant ship officers and masters  that they learnt the Allied Convoy Orders system with its specific flag and other signals  forming up into columns and the other responsibilities of ships in convoy. Having foreign shipping in a convoy had been planned and the entire convoy system and its signals were kept simple. It was just as well because the Atlantic would be the longest fought battle  lasting from the first to the last day of WW2.<p>     Instructions on convoying merchant ships were already in the secret orders kept in the safe of all warships and commencement of the system went quite smoothly. Perhaps the only difficulties were that it had seldom been rehearsed and with so much done in theory  warships had very little practice at depth charge attacks.<p>      Atlantic convoys met with a close escort at a MOMP (Mid Ocean Meeting Point) if inbound  or if outbound were escorted to it.  Only Battleships  AMC's and cruisers accompanied the convoys in the central Atlantic. On the western side of the Atlantic escorts operating out of Canada met them. But the central Atlantic was vulnerable. Coastal Command aircraft could not reach out that far  and few escorts had sufficient 'legs' to stay with a convoy the whole distance.<p>     Fortunately for the British the German submarine force was still lacking numbers. This was especially so of the larger long-range boats. Later the possession of French Atlantic ports allowed the U Boats available to spend more time at sea and the U Boats were finally able to start limited Wolf Pack tactics. But initially U Boats had to travel to patrol areas from Germany and they were few in number.<p>,,,Premium Color 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Matte Lam,82,,,,1-Sep-11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,6024045,W.

Dictionary of Automatic Ideas: A New Translation Bringing Flaubert into the 21st Century,9.78161E+12,1608881482,Available for Printing/Download,Case Laminate,ENG,,,,0,"Flaubert, Gustave","Hosseini, Baharak","Zimmerman, W. Frederick",Author,Translator,Editor,,,,LIT004150,LITERARY CRITICISM / European / French,HIS013000,HISTORY / Europe / France,REF019000,REFERENCE / Quotations,Nimble Books LLC,,,,,,"Living in today's multi-speed world is so exasperatingly in-tense for so many people that a great majority of them find solace in routine and automatism. The clich� has become not only a conscious strategy to conform  but a response to anxiety and despair. Humans are therefore increasingly losing their individual voice and adopting ready-made  stale  worn-out and often inaccurate clich�s that trivialize noble ideas and the power of one. In fact  with the advent of ""smart"" technology  free speech  memory and intelligence are becoming endangered species. Ironically  the last several decades of ""contact"" and social networking have nurtured the sport of clich� ping-ponging. It is in such circumstances that I have translated Gustave Flaubert's Dictionnaire des id�es re�ues  a brilliant questioning of conventional wisdom and a subtle representation of the transformation of Man by the machinery of capitalism.<p>Since Dictionnaire des id�es recues is a microcosm of Flaubert's world  its translation was anything but simple. The task was not only to jump from clich� to clich� while carrying the color and context of the original text  but to contemporize it so that the historical narrative fits into a more modern context. The first dilemma was to decide whether the definitions should be translated identically throughout  or whether a factually different equivalent should be chosen. Such was the case of fungi/fungus as the translation of the French shakos/chacal. Another rather constant difficulty was whether to say ""you"" or ""one"" for the French pronoun ""on""  the indefinite subject par excellence. Finally  I have given myself the freedom to use quotation marks in order to stress a word within the pre-constructed thought.<p>May this new interpretation serve as an introduction to Flaubert's work and entice new readers to want to learn more. And may those who already know the author believe that I have done all that I could.<p>",,,B&W 5 x 8 in or 203 x 127 mm Case Laminate on White w/Matte Lam,118,,N,,31-Aug-11,15-Aug-11,26.99,20.99,33.99,24.99,36.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,26.99,,24.95,26.99,26.99,26.99,24.95,24.95,26.99,26.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

The doctrinal underpinnings of air power thought are  of course  traditionally ascribed to the three great theorists of air power application  Douhet  Trenchard  and Mitchell. Since the Second World War  the air power community has not often explored the doctrinal implications of air power development. Lord Tedder's Lee Knowles lectures at Cambridge  and the writings of Air Vice Marshal R. A. Mason  and Colonel John A. Warden I11 constitute notable-and noteworthy-exceptions. Now comes Colonel Phillip Meilinger  who has posited a group of provocative propositions that will instill an apprecia-tion for air power for those who seek to understand it and challenge the assumptions of those who do not yet appreciate what it offers.

Meininger's book  <i>Ten Propositions Regarding Air Power.</i> As the United States ponders its future regarding space operations  the time has come to frame similar propositions regarding spacepower.  Specifically  this study seeks to answer the question  ""What is the nature of spacepower?"" It also test the aerospace integration school's hypothesis that spacepower is simply a continuation or extension of airpower. Two points come immediately to the forefront of this work. First  spacepower is different from airpower even though both share the vertical dimension of warfare.  Second  space operations have matured to a point where valid and unique propositions regarding spacepower are identifiable. The ten propositions presented here do not represent a complete list. The method used to derive these propositions involved literary research that result in a long list. The list evolved over three years during numerous brainstorming with several space experts--most of them space weapons officers with theater and often combat experience--until the list was carefully refined into the ten most salient propositions. There were many ways to present the Ten Propositions Regarding Spacepower  but the author deferred to Meininger's approach of citing each proposition as a thesis statement with supporting material immediately following. The objective of this work is to stimulate discussions and help those who do not yet understand or appreciate the nature of spacepower in modern warfare.",,"Space power,space warfare",B&W 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Matte Lam,156,,N,,24-Aug-11,26-Aug-11,22.99,16.99,28.99,20.99,30.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,22.99,,21.36,22.99,22.99,22.99,21.36,21.36,22.99,22.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

The German Sixth Army consisted of over 300 000 men when it approached Stalingrad in August 1942. On 2 February 1943  91 000 remained; only some 5 000 survived Soviet captivity. Largely due to the success of previous aerial resupply operations  Luftwaffe leaders assured Hitler they could successfully supply the Sixth Army after it was trapped. However  the Luftwaffe was not up to the challenge. The primary reason was the weather  but organizational and structural flaws  as well as enemy actions  also contributed to their failure. This thesis will address why the Demyansk and Kholm airlifts convinced the Germans that airlift was a panacea for encircled forces; the lessons learned from these airlifts and how they were applied at Stalingrad; why Hitler ordered the Stalingrad airlift despite the logistical impossibility; and seek out lessons for todayxs military. The primary reason for the Stalingrad tragedy was that Germany' strategic leadership did not apply lessons learned from earlier airlifts to the Stalingrad airlift  and the U.S. military is making similar mistakes with respect to the way it is handling its lessons learned from recent military operations,,,B&W 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Matte Lam,108,,N,,23-Aug-11,30-Aug-11,16.99,12.99,20.99,14.99,22.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,16.99,,15.38,16.99,16.99,16.99,15.38,15.38,16.99,16.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

Given that building a warship could take anywhere from less than a year for a destroyer  to over three years for a battleship or aircraft carrier  it is clear that the foresighted building of warships in the years prior to US involvement in World War II would play a major role in enabling the US Navy to counter and eventually defeat the Imperial Japanese Navy in the Pacific. In order to trace the evolving influences behind this warship building program  this thesis divides the pre-war period into three separate phases: Phase 1 is bounded by Roosevelt's inauguration and the USS Panay incident  phase two runs from the USS Panay incident until the fall of France  and phase three covers from the fall of France until the attack on Pearl Harbor.

They use the rhetoric of democracy to thwart the majority will.  An introduction sets the historical context since World War II.<p>What's harder to state are the precise means by which elites consis-tently obtain the public policy outcomes they prefer. We the electorate find ourselves complicit in public policy decisions whose deeper intent  had we been able to discern it  we might have opposed.

While the author admits to a certain shameless admiration for bottom-feeding puns  the angel of his better nature strives for more elevated forms of wordplay. The reader should bear in mind that these words-neo  nasty or not-do far less public harm than the gush of self-referential pieties that elites endlessly promote. Were the top-up crowd ever to opt for the semantic directness found here  a new day would be upon us.

Contemporaries  on the other hand  recognized his eminence and influence.<p>The dialogue with Fukuzawa has a somewhat different purpose from that with earlier thinkers of the western Enlightenment treated in my previous work. The work of Montesquieu  Smith and Tocqueville  when combined  set out a set of conjectures as to how mankind could and perhaps did 'escape' from the normal tendencies of agrarian civilization. Since Fukuzawa (1835-1901) was writing later  and at a great distance from the original 'escape'  it is unlikely that he will be able to contribute much that is original to the analysis of this problem. For that we have already considered Maitland's impressive solution. On the other hand  Fukuzawa provides an interesting test case for the utility of their theories.<p>If their model is plausible and seems to have explanatory power  it should be attractive to a thinker whose aim  as we shall see  is to grasp the essence of the first transition from agrarian to industrial civilization so that he can help his own Japanese civilization achieve a similar break-through. If he selects and approves the same central essence as Montesquieu  Smith  Tocqueville and Maitland  their insights would appear to have cross-cultural validity.<p>An even more stringent test is the degree of success in the material world. In other words  did the recipe work? If an outsider to Europe not only repeated the central theories of those who addressed the riddle of the origins of the modern world  but then applied these to a distant civilization and helped to effect a similar 'escape' in entirely different circumstances  this would be as good a confirmation of the validity of the theory as one could hope for.<p>The task is made more worthwhile because  despite his eminence and interest  there has only been one book about him in English  and that was also about other thinkers in the Japanese Enlightenment. There have been one or two articles also  but there is no recent intellectual biography of a man who had an enormous impact on Japanese civilization and whose ideas are such a wonderful mirror of western thought and colonial expansion. <p>,,,B&W 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,98,,N,,30-Jun-11,13-Jun-11,24.99,18.99,30.99,22.99,32.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,24.99,,22.84,24.99,24.99,24.99,22.84,22.84,24.99,24.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

He was the son of a clergyman and one of eight children. He was educated at Jesus College  Cambridge and later became Professor of History and Political Economy at the East India Company's College at Haileybury in Hertfordshire. His most famous work  the Essay on the Principles of Population  was published in 1798 when he was 32. It has been seen partly as a reaction to the Utopian thought of William Godwin and others  as well as that of Malthus' own father. It is as an extension and formalization of the ideas of the classical economist Adam Smith and others who had laid down some of the basic ideas concerning the tendency of population to outstrip resources.Malthus' theory in brief was that humankind is permanently trapped by the intersection of two 'laws'. The first concerned the rate at which populations can grow. He took the 'passion between the sexes' to be constant and investigations showed that under conditions of 'natural' fertility (with early marriage and no contraception  abortion or infanticide)  this would lead to an average of about fifteen livebirths per woman. This figure is confirmed by modern demography. Given normal mortality at the time  and taking a less than maximum fertility  this will lead to what Malthus called geometrical growth  namely 1 2 4 8 16. It only needs 32 doublings like this to lead from an original couple to the present world population of over six billion persons. The second premise was that food and other resource production will grow much more slowly. It might double for a generation or two  but could not keep on doubling within an agrarian economy. Thus there could  in the long run  only be an arithmetic or linear growth of the order of 1 2 3 4. Incorporated in this later theory was the law of diminishing marginal returns on the further input of resources  especially labour. Underpinning the scheme was the assumption that there was a finite amount of energy available for humans through the conversion of the sun's energy by living plants and animals. The conclusion was that humankind was trapped  a particular application in the field of demography of the more general pessimism of Adam Smith. Populations would grow rapidly for a few generations  and then be savagely cut back. A crisis would occur  manifesting itself in one (or a combination) of what he called the three 'positive' checks acting on the death rate  war  famine and disease.,,,B&W 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,140,,N,,30-Jun-11,1-Jul-11,26.99,20.99,33.99,24.99,36.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,26.99,,24.99,26.99,26.99,26.99,24.99,24.99,26.99,26.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

Filson Young: the Bob Woodward of battlecruisers.An excerpt:Here  then  was the ideal type for which Lord Fisher in our conversations had so often sighed; and I was secretly disappointed when  on my mentioning Fisher's name  Beatty merely smiled. And I was still more crestfallen when  a few days later  I spoke of Beatty enthusiastically to Lord Fisher  he gave me a blank  sour look and said: ""Really? Never met him.""I did not know the Navy as well in those days as I know it now  or I would have been less surprised than I was that the obviously ablest men in control of naval affairs were far from seeing eye to eye with one another  and even (what was more remarkable) neglected to make any real study of one another's aims and potentialities. Naval thought  where it existed  was divided into camps  each one regarding victory over the others as essential to victory over the Germans. Thus Lord Charles Beresford  whose best work in his retirement was his untiring public advocacy of naval efficiency  gave one in private a most alarming impression that the Navy was already practically in German control; and one of his mildest views of Lord Fisher was that he was a madman who  on the eve of war  had deliberately scrapped the majority of our cruisers. Winston Churchill was at one time probably one of the men most disliked by the Navy at large; but when one tried to discuss his administration seriously  one was told stories of his bad manners: as  for example  of his going on board a ship  entering the wardroom  ringing the bell and sending for the Commander - a solecism the gravity of which one must have lived in a wardroom to appreciate. And yet  one felt  it was not quite an argument against his efficiency as an administrator. But all the naval officer saw was a man to whose power our sacred naval traditions were committed  and who apparently knew or cared so little for the smallest of them that the greatest might well be in peril at his hands. The anti-Churchill camp was a very strong one. He  on the other hand  seemed to regard Lord Fisher as a dangerous genius to be caught  chained  tamed  and made careful use of; Lord Fisher regarded him (I am speaking of the two years before the war) as a politician to be fought or flattered  made or destroyed  according to his degree of adaptability to the great purpose.",,,B&W 6 x 9 in or 229 x 152 mm Case Laminate on White w/Matte Lam,382,,N,,31-May-11,13-Jun-11,31.99,23.99,38.99,27.99,41.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,31.99,,28.68,31.99,31.99,31.99,28.68,28.68,31.99,31.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

Among them are those who courageously face repeated hospitalizations  surgeries  feeding tubes  dialysis  EEGs  respiration and heart monitors  and a life-time of therapy. Lexie has a medical condition that requires her to spend a lot of time in therapy  at hospitals  and in doctors' offices. She knows first-hand just how difficult  painful  and scary  these experiences can be. ""Be brave and know that you are not alone"" is Lexie's message  as she encourages young children who face these challenges in Brave Just Like Me.<p>Brave Just Like Me was inspired by a three year old girl named Lexie  who was born with a life threatening medical condition. One day  shortly after Lexie returned home from her second kidney transplant surgery  her mother held her in her arms while she slept.  It was a day like many others  but as her mother gazed in deepest admiration on her brave little girl  the words to this book were born - not in a slow or uncertain trickle but in strong  overpowering waves. So compelling was this experience  that Lexie's mother laid her sleeping child in bed to capture these words in writing.  Inspired by love and a deep desire to acknowledge  comfort  and encourage children who face the same hardships her daughter experiences  Kimberly wrote her first children's book. <p>It was only a matter of days before this first time author found an illustrator  who not only offered but insisted on painting the illustrations for the book and donating the artwork.  Stacy spent years painting for the book  as her schedule allowed  and through many personal challenges. Through Stacy  Kimberly found Leslie  a graphic design artist who helped finish the illustrations and set words to art  again donating her work to the cause  despite her own personal hardships. The book moved from Stacy  to Leslie  to Aaron  who volunteered to scan the artwork into print ready files. The book then found its way to a publisher  who not only believed enough in the book to publish it  but valued an affordable price point over profit to ensure the book reached those who needed it most.  So  really  Brave Just Like Me has two stories to tell - one about a brave little girl and one about the kindness and goodness of people.  <p>Each person who has touched this book wants only one thing from this endeavor - to comfort and encourage young children who are working courageously to overcome the pain and disabilities that often accompany serious and life threatening medical conditions.

We would encourage anyone who purchases this book for a loved one to also consider donating a copy to a local children's hospital  pediatrician  therapist  or Ronald McDonald House.""  Recognizing that these children aren't the only ones who need comforting and encouragement  the author invites the parents of children facing serious and life threatening medical conditions to join the virtual support group she created precisely for this purpose at bravejustlikeme.com.<p>",,,Premium Color 8 x 10 in or 254 x 203 mm Case Laminate on White w/Gloss Lam,36,,,,29-Apr-11,27-Apr-11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,6024045,W.

The Beauties of Shakespear was his most successful book and played a key role in reviving Shakespeare's popularity. This is a facsimile edition.<p>From the author's preface to this collection of ""Greatest Hits"":<p>I shall not attempt any labored encomiums of  Shakspeare  or endeavor to set forth his perfections  at a time when such universal and just applause is paid him  and when every tongue is big  with his boundless fame. He himself tells us -<p>To gild refined gold  to paint the lily <br> To throw a perfume on the violet <br>  To smooth the ice  or add another hue  <br>Unto the rainbow  or with taper-light<br>  To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish  <br> Is wasteful and ridiculous excess."" <br>And wasteful and ridiculous indeed it would be to  say anything in his praise  when presenting the  world with such a collection of Beauties as per-  haps is nowhere to be met with  and  I may very  safely affirm  cannot be paralleled from the produc-  tions of any other single author  ancient or modern.  There is scarcely a topic  common with other writers   on which he has not excelled them all; there are  many nobly peculiar to himself  where he shines  unrivalled  and like the eagle  properest emblem of  his daring genius  soars beyond the common reach  and gazes undazzled on the sun.<p>",,,"B&W 5.5 x 8.5 in or 216 x 140 mm (Demy 8vo) Blue Digital Cloth!

Martin electrified fantasy fans around the world when he published A Game of Thrones  the first book in his acclaimed A Song of Ice and Fire series. Since then  Martin has published three more books in the series. The engrossing tale Martin spun with these first novels in his saga has gained more and more fans across the world and has resulted in a number of spin-off products  such including HBO's TV series  card and board games  computer games  sword replicas  comic books and calendars. Perhaps paradoxically  the number of years between each time Martin publishes a new book in the series has increased. Fans have been clamoring for the fifth volume  A Dance with Dragons  since 2005: A book that promises to pick up the storylines of fan-favorite characters left hanging since 1999. As Martin struggles to reach the finish line  or indeed even the halfway point in his epic  his fans wait for the next fix. One way to keep sane during the long waits is to re-read the already published novels.<p>Journey to Westeros with Remy J. Verhoeve as he celebrates his tenth reading of A Game of Thrones.

These experiences aren't always fun. The medicine tastes bad and the shots hurt.  ""Be brave and know that you are not alone"" is Lexie's message  as she encourages young children who face these same challenges in Brave Just Like Me.<p>By age 8 most children brave getting a shot  taking medicine  an x-ray or two  and quite likely a brief hospitalization or emergency room visit.  Among them are those who courageously face repeated hospitalizations  surgeries  feeding tubes  dialysis  EEGs  respiration and heart monitors  and a life-time of therapy. Lexie has a medical condition that requires her to spend a lot of time in therapy  at hospitals  and in doctors' offices. She knows first-hand just how difficult  painful  and scary  these experiences can be. ""Be brave and know that you are not alone"" is Lexie's message  as she encourages young children who face these challenges in Brave Just Like Me.<p>Brave Just Like Me was inspired by a three year old girl named Lexie  who was born with a life threatening medical condition. One day  shortly after Lexie returned home from her second kidney transplant surgery  her mother held her in her arms while she slept.  It was a day like many others  but as her mother gazed in deepest admiration on her brave little girl  the words to this book were born - not in a slow or uncertain trickle but in strong  overpowering waves. So compelling was this experience  that Lexie's mother laid her sleeping child in bed to capture these words in writing.  Inspired by love and a deep desire to acknowledge  comfort  and encourage children who face the same hardships her daughter experiences  Kimberly wrote her first children's book. <p>It was only a matter of days before this first time author found an illustrator  who not only offered but insisted on painting the illustrations for the book and donating the artwork.  Stacy spent years painting for the book  as her schedule allowed  and through many personal challenges. Through Stacy  Kimberly found Leslie  a graphic design artist who helped finish the illustrations and set words to art  again donating her work to the cause  despite her own personal hardships. The book moved from Stacy  to Leslie  to Aaron  who volunteered to scan the artwork into print ready files. The book then found its way to a publisher  who not only believed enough in the book to publish it  but valued an affordable price point over profit to ensure the book reached those who needed it most.  So  really  Brave Just Like Me has two stories to tell - one about a brave little girl and one about the kindness and goodness of people.  <p>Each person who has touched this book wants only one thing from this endeavor - to comfort and encourage young children who are working courageously to overcome the pain and disabilities that often accompany serious and life threatening medical conditions. ""It is our sincerest hope that Brave Just Like Me finds its way into the hands of these precious children.  We would encourage anyone who purchases this book for a loved one to also consider donating a copy to a local children's hospital  pediatrician  therapist  or Ronald McDonald House.""  Recognizing that these children aren't the only ones who need comforting and encouragement  the author invites the parents of children facing serious and life threatening medical conditions to join the virtual support group she created precisely for this purpose at bravejustlikeme.com.<p>",,,Premium Color 8 x 10 in or 254 x 203 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,32,,N,,5-Apr-11,17-Feb-11,9.99,7,11,9,11,20,25,20,20,20,No,No,No,No,No,9.99,,9.99,,,,,9.99,9.99,,20,,20,,,,,20,20,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

While not every sailor who served on PT boats went through the training at MTBSTC  every PT sailor was affected by what went on there. The MTBSTC created the PT boats' operational policies and tactics  as well as weapons and equipment experimentation and development. Even the orders the men received for their PT boat assignment were dictated by the MTBSTC. Most of the books written about PT boats have only a passing reference to the MTBSTC. This lack of detailed information on the Training Center has left a large hole in the overall printed history of PT boats. This book fills that gap.</p><p>This book documents the Training Center from its beginnings when the land was undeveloped swampland  through its growing pains during construction and expansion during the war. It traces the problems of developing a training curriculum from scratch  the struggles to keep the training current  up through the point when the training reached its peak of proficiency just as the war ended. It provides insight into what life was like for the sailors that spent two to three months going through the training program and of those who were stationed at the Training Center as instructors or staff personnel. This book also details the Training Center's post-war career and its current development as a thriving marina and boat building enterprise.</p><p>This book is culled from the MTBSTC's wartime correspondence files and other deck logs  published and unpublished books  articles  and reports; and interviews with PT boat veterans who underwent the training at the MTBSTC. It is lavishly illustrated with archival  private  and public photographs  most of which have never been published before.</p><p>This book is an essential element of the written history of the PT boats in World War II.</p><p><br></p>,,"coastal forces,motor torpedo boat,mtb,pt boat,torpedo boat",Premium Color 8 x 10 in or 254 x 203 mm Case Laminate on White w/Gloss Lam,354,,N,,1-Mar-11,8-Feb-11,78.99,59.99,98.99,70.99,104.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,78.99,,72,78.99,78.99,78.99,72,72,78.99,78.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

One of its sections is a systematic description of the appropriate uses of shall and will. The third and last edition was published in 1931  by which time Modern English Usage had superseded it in popularity.<p>Because all living languages continually evolve  the book is now considered outdated in some respects; and some of the Fowlers' opinions about correct English usage are at times incorrect with regard to contemporary standards. For example  the Fowlers disapprove of the word ""concision"" on the grounds that it had a technical meaning in theology  ""to which it may well be left""; although ""concision"" is now a common synonym for ""conciseness""  it is still an ugly word. The Fowlers also criticised the use of standpoint and just how much (as in ""Just how much more of this can we take?"")  describing them as undesirable ""Americanisms""  but both are now common in British English.

September 11 and crises like it are matters that grab all of our hearts.  Adrienne Redd was a mom (and sociology professor) when the events of September 11  2001 transpired. That day led her on a seven-year journey to make  sense of changing political order and earn a doctoral degree.  She has a down-to-earth approach to political scholarship.How are global events eroding and pressuring traditional political institutions  such as the nation?  Her book offers an affirmative rather than doomsday picture of how the public and our leaders need to re-think how the world is organized at the highest levels.   Fallen Walls and Fallen Towers describes in entertaining terms how the nation was conceived about 350 years ago  how it grew to meet the needs of the industrial age  how it is being threatened by several trends of globalization  and how ordinary people and leaders really can influence its survival by how they think and talk about national government. In what ways do people have to reconsider fundamental concepts like boundaries and sovereignty in order to foster future social stability?

After a brief introduction and an explanation of the significance of Norway  Chapter Three will analyze the planning process and strategy used by the Germans in late 1939 and early 1940 for devising this joint operation. Chapter Four examines  primarily from an airpower perspective  the plan itself and its execution during the first day of the operation by the Germans  and the British response. Chapter Five determines how German airpower was used  and in particular  what effect the Luftwaffe attack on 9 April against the British Home Fleet had against Britain's campaign strategy to control the North Sea. The final chapter examines three important lessons United States military planners should extract from Operation Weseruebung and apply to operations in the 21st century. They are: 1) the joint operation of air  land  and sea assets produce a synergetic effect greater than the sum of their parts; 2) a difficult part of joint operations is the air command and control; and 3) airpower can decisively deny the enemy use of the land or the sea.,,,B&W 8.25 x 11 in or 280 x 210 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,48,,N,,7-Sep-10,30-Mar-10,20.99,15.99,25.99,18.99,27.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,20.99,,19.05,20.99,20.99,20.99,19.05,19.05,20.99,20.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

Thousands of pictures are preserved in the photographic libraries of the armed services but are little seen by the public. <p>In the narrative volumes of UNITED STATES ARMY IN WORLD WAR II  now being prepared by the Office of the Chief of Military History of the United States Army  it is possible to include only a limited number of pictures. Therefore  a subseries of pictorial volumes  of which this is the last  has been planned to supplement the other volumes of the series. The photographs have been especially selected to show important terrain features  types of equipment and weapons  living and weather conditions  military operations  and matters of human interest. These volumes will preserve and make accessible for future reference some of the best pictures of World War II. An appreciation not only of the terrain upon which actions were fought  but also of its influence on the capabilities and limitations of weapons in the hands of both our troops and those of the enemy  can be gained through a careful study of the pictures herein presented. These factors are essential to a clear understanding of military history. The text was written and the photographs compiled by Capt. Kenneth E. Hunter and Miss Margaret E. Tackley; the volume was edited by Miss Mary Ann Bacon. The book deals with the Pacific Theater of Operations and is divided into six sections: (1) The Allied Defensive; (2) The Strategic Defensive and Tactical Offensive; (3) The Offensive-1944; (4) The Final Phase; (5) The China-Burma-India Theater; and (6) The Collapse of Japan and the End of the War in the Pacific. Each section is arranged in chronological order. All dates used are local dates  and it should be remembered that all dates west of the International Date Line are one day ahead of those east of the line.

Napoleon  however  changed all of this and in a few short years transformed the French army into the most powerful force on the continent of Europe. During the period of 1805 to 1813  Napoleon's army had no equal with regard to operational effectiveness. Speed and positioning of forces were the two main characteristics that made the French army so successful. These same two characteristics were also inherent to French cavalry units. Thus  the central research question is: What influence did cavalry have upon Napoleon's operations? To facilitate this study  two campaigns were examined that illustrate cavalry's impact on Napoleon's operations. The first campaign was the Jena Campaign of 1806; the second was the Saxony Campaign of 1813. The Jena Campaign demonstrated that with the employment of sufficient and well-trained cavalry  Napoleon could render his victories decisive through the complete destruction of the enemy army. Conversely  the Saxony Campaign demonstrated that without the effective employment of sufficient and well-trained cavalry  Napoleon could not obtain the complete destruction of the enemy army and thus  his victories were hollow  or at best Pyrrhic. Therefore  based on the analysis of these two campaigns  this study has concluded that Napoleon's cavalry was a key element for Napoleon achieving complete destruction of the enemy army  thus rendering his victories decisive.,,,B&W 8.25 x 11 in or 280 x 210 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,114,,N,,13-Jul-10,21-Apr-10,20.99,15.99,25.99,18.99,27.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,20.99,,19.05,20.99,20.99,20.99,19.05,19.05,20.99,20.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

The German Navy was stripped of its battleships  submarines  and aircraft. The effort to rebuild began immediately following the war. The decision about what direction and shape the Navy would take was influenced by several factors. The German Navy's anticipated enemy  the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles  and the political situation all played a part in the development of the post-World War I German Navy. At least as important as any of these factors was the influence of two prominent naval theorists  A.T. Mahan  and Sir Julian Corbett. This thesis examined the extent that the theories of Mahan and Corbett influenced the development of German Naval Strategy between 1930 and 1936. The period includes the remnants of the Weimar Republic  the ascension of Adolf Hitler  and the signing of the Anglo-German Naval agreement in 1935  and finally the first of naval developments after the treaty. <p>Understanding the role of Mahan in the development of the Kriegsmarine is essential for any student of modern naval history.<p>,,,B&W 8.25 x 11 in or 280 x 210 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,70,,N,,6-Jul-10,5-Apr-10,17.99,13.99,22.99,15.99,23.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,17.99,,16.55,17.99,17.99,17.99,16.55,16.55,17.99,17.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

By early 2009  a growing number of Members of Congress  Administration officials  and outside experts had concluded that the effort-often called ""America's other war""-required greater national attention. For the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA)  the war is both a struggle for survival and an effort to establish sustainable security and stability. For the United States  the war in Afghanistan concerns the security of Afghanistan and the region  including denying safe haven to terrorists and helping ensure a stable regional security balance. For regional states  including India and Russia as well as Afghanistan's neighbors Pakistan and Iran  the war may have a powerful impact on the future balance of power and influence in the region. For individual members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  the war may be about defeating terrorist networks  ensuring regional stability  proving themselves as contributing NATO members  and/or demonstrating NATO's relevance in the 21st century. <p>Since 2001  the character of the war in Afghanistan has evolved from a violent struggle against al Qaeda and its Taliban supporters to a multi-faceted counterinsurgency (COIN) effort. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11  2001  the United States launched Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in order to end the ability of the Taliban regime to provide safe haven to al Qaeda and to put a stop to al Qaeda's use of the territory of Afghanistan as a base of operations for terrorist activities. In that first phase  U.S. and coalition forces  working with Afghan opposition forces  quickly removed the Taliban regime. <p>After the fall of the Taliban  the character of the war shifted to a multifaceted COIN effort aimed at smothering the diffuse insurgency by shoring up GIRoA efforts to provide security  governance  and economic development. The three areas are generally viewed as interdependent and mutually-reinforcing-security is a prerequisite for some governance and development efforts  and longer-term  sustainable security requires both functional governance and economic opportunity. As one pillar of the COIN campaign in Afghanistan  the Afghan and international military effort aims broadly at defeating the remnants of the Taliban and other insurgents  securing the population  and helping extend the reach of the Afghan government. The international military effort includes both the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)  to which the United States contributes troops  and the separate U.S.-led OEF mission. <p>In his December 3  2009  speech President Obama identified several objectives in Afghanistan and Pakistan: (1) disrupt  dismantle  and defeat al Qaeda; (2) deny al Qaeda a safe haven; (3) reverse the Taliban's momentum and deny it the ability to overthrow the government; and (4) strengthen the capacity of the Afghan security forces and government to better protect and serve population centers. To accomplish this  President Obama ordered the deployment of an additional 30 000 troops to the region  which will bring the U.S. total to almost 100 000 troops. This deployment will be staged over several months  with the full additional complement being in-country by the end of the summer 2010. Noting that Afghan operations continue to be an international effort  President Obama expressed confidence that some of 42 coalition allies will also be increasing their contributions.

Its goals were toprovide annotated historical references for the combat experiences ofprevious light divisions and to list historical sources on the force designprocess  especially in regard to attempts to lighten the force or to respondto improvements in technology on the battlefield. The first draft of thisbibliography was distributed in September and October 1983 as a quickreference to force planners across the Army.Since that time  the bibliography has been expanded  but the generalfocus remains the same  historical light divisions and the force designprocess. It addresses light infantry forces of the twentieth century withprimary emphasis on World War II and later. This document can serve as astarting point for force designers' research into the origins organizations  capabilities  and combat experiences of light infantry forces.In order to permit widespread distribution of this bibliography  onlyunclassified sources have been cited. However  additional classifieddocuments on the subject exist  particularly in regard to technical analysesof force capabilities.

The continuing usefulness of light forces goes beyond their ease of deployment. Light infantry exemplifies a state of mind that reveals itself in a unique tactical style  versatility  and elan that are so vital in battle.<p>While the structure of light infantry makes it admirably equipped to fight in restricted terrain  it operates at considerable disadvantage in areas more suited to heavy forces. As with any military organization  commanders must consider both the capabilities and limitations of light infantry before committing it to battle. Major Scott R  McMichael provides a valuable historical perspective for understanding the characteristics  organization  and operations of light infantry forces.<p>Major McMichael's Research Survey examines four light infantry forces operating in varying settings: the Chindits in the 1944 Burma campaign against the Japanese: the Chinese Communist Forces during the Korean War; British operations in Malaya and Borneo from 1948 to 1966: and the First Special Service Force in its battles in the mountains of Itali during World War II.  These examples are diverse in terms of time  areas of operations  and opposing forces  yet they reveal common characteristics of light forces and their operations.<p>A Historical Perspective on Light Infantry is based on extensive research in primary and secondary historical sources. The author has uncovered numerous doctrinal and operational manuals and reports and has gone beyond them to explore the more personal side of light infantry operations. This study is both fascinating reading and a valuable historica  analysis of the capabilities and limitations of light infantry when faced with the test of battle. <p>,,,B&W 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,252,,N,,30-Jun-10,9-Jul-10,19.99,14.99,24.99,17.99,26.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,19.99,,18.19,19.99,19.99,19.99,18.19,18.19,19.99,19.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

The Royal Air Force adopted the offensive use of airpower to attack enemy sources power as its primary mission and focused on defeating the enemy nation. Great Britain's national strategic situation  its lessons from World War I  and its air leadership all contributed toward this adoption. The Germansituation was different. Its lessons from World War I  its traditional views on the roles of its army  its strategic situation  and its fragmented air leadership contributed toward its adoption of an air doctrine that focused on defeating enemy military forces  not enemy sources of power. The Treaty of Versailles also restricted the size of its military and the kinds of aircraft it could build  affecting its air force's mission. This thesis addresses the development of a new technology and its adoption as either a doctrinal evolution or revolution.

It was followed 3years later by the introduction of the term ""operationalart"" which was  in practice  the skillful managementof the operational level of war. This conception ofan identifiably separate level of war that definedthe jurisdiction of the profession of arms was  for anumber of historical and cultural reasons  attractive toU.S. practitioners and plausible to its English-speakingallies. As a result  it and its associated doctrine spreadrapidly around the world.<p>This monograph argues that the idea of anoperational level of war charged with the planning andconduct of campaigns misconceives the relationshipbetween wars  campaigns  and operations  and is bothhistorically mistaken and wrong in theory. BrigadierJustin Kelly (Australian Army Retired) and Dr. MichaelBrennan conclude that its incorporation into U.S.doctrine has had the regrettable impact of separatingthe conduct of campaigns from the conduct of warsand consequently marginalized the role of politics inthe direction of war. In essence  they argue that theidea of the campaign has come to overwhelm that ofstrategy.<p>This monograph argues that as warfare continues todiffuse across definitional and conceptual boundariesand as the close orchestration of all of the instrumentsof national power becomes even more important the current conception of campaigns and operationsbecomes crippling. To cope with these demands byformulating and prosecuting ""national campaigns ""the authors propose that the responsibility forcampaign design should ""actually"" return to thepolitical-strategic leadership of nations supported bythe entirety of the state bureaucracy.

While conventional naval warfare holds the premier position in naval affairs  MIW constitutes a less understood but equally important other tradition that merits closer attention. History demonstrates a link between the evolution of regular naval warfare and its irregular counterpart. when fully understood and correctly utilized  MIW actions have proven extremely effective at providing unconventional solutions to complex military problems. Consistently  MIW forces have powerfully affected the outcomes of conflict both at sea and on land. Through the skillful employment of MIW  this long historical pattern can continue to affect conflicts of the 21st century. In an era of rapid change  the ability to clearly identify and understand emerging trends in conflict and military affairs is an essential element in assessing MIW's future. As conventional warfare begins to realign for future threats  practitioners of MIW need to begin thinking proactively about how MIW can stay relevant and the concerted actions that need to be taken in order to fit into the future of warfare.

For years  North Korea's military provocations have been obvious to the world  however  much of its decisionmaking is shrouded in secrecy  particularly that of a wide-range of clandestine activities. This monograph is unique in the way that it sheds light on the illicit activities of the regime  and how those illegal activities are used to support its military programs and the government itself. From drug trafficking to counterfeiting  from money laundering to cigarette smuggling  North Korea's Central Committee Bureau 39 is an active participant in the criminal economy of the region with tentacles extending well beyond Asia. The authors discuss how these activities have negative strategic consequences for a number of stakeholders and nations throughout the region while describing how such activities provide critical funding streams for military programs and regime supporters. As a result  North Korea is not just a ""rogue state "" but practices what is essentially criminal sovereignty whereby it organizes its illegitimate activities behind the shield of non-intervention while using the tools of the state to perpetrate these schemes abroad.

So too has the number of operational  political  and legal questions associated with this technology. The growing demand for and reliance on unmanned systems has serious implications  both on and off the battlefield. <p>As the United States is engaged in two wars abroad  unmanned systems  particularly unmanned aerial vehicles  have become a centerpiece of that war effort. In recent years  the Department of Defense's UAV inventory has rapidly grown in size  from 167 in 2002 to over seven thousand today. Last year  for the first time  the U.S. Air Force trained more unmanned pilots than traditional fighter pilots. <p>Some express no doubt that unmanned systems have been a boost to U.S. war efforts in the Middle East and South Asia. CIA Director Leon Panetta said last May that ""drone strikes are the only game in town in terms of confronting or trying to disrupt the al Qaeda leadership."" Media reports over the last year that the top two leaders of the Pakistani Taliban were killed by drone strikes also support this argument. <p>But some critics argue that drone strikes are unethical at best and counterproductive at worst. They point to the reportedly high rate of civilian casualties  which has been calculated by the New American Foundation to be around 32 percent  and argue that the strikes do more to stoke anti-Americanism than they do to weaken our enemies. A quick skim of any Pakistani newspaper provides some evidence to support this theory. This is particularly relevant in the era of counter-insurgency doctrine  a central tenet of which is  'first  do no harm.' <p>It also may be the case that we are fighting wars with modern technology under an antiquated set of laws. For example  if the United States uses unmanned weapons systems  does that require an official declaration of war or an authorization for the use of force? <p>",,,B&W 8.25 x 11 in or 280 x 210 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,128,,N,,31-May-10,28-Jul-10,18.99,13.99,22.99,16.99,24.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,18.99,,16.95,18.99,18.99,18.99,16.95,16.95,18.99,18.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

Yet the German airborne branch literally self-destructed in 1941. What happened  how did the Germans react  and what historical insights in the use of airborne forces can modern day planners derive from the German experience? <p>In the late 1930's  an aggressive and innovative rearmament program in Nazi Germany gave rise to the tactics of vertical envelopment. Pioneering the use of gliders as troop carriers  parachutists  and the air landing of reinforcements to exploit tactical success  the German Wehrmacht used the new technique of airborne warfare with startling success as part of the Blitzkrieg campaign against the Low Countries and France in 1940. When the tactical doctrine used to seize bridges  strong points and road junctions in Fall Gelb was transferred to the seizure of an entire island that was heavily defended in 1941  however  the German airborne effectively committed suicide. In ten days in May 1941  half the airborne forces in the entire German army were killed or wounded on Crete. Hitler wrongly ascribed the disaster to a playing out of the surprise factor  and banned further parachute operations until 1943. The right conclusions were arrived at by the commander of the German airborne himself  General Kurt Student  in post-battle analysis. His own insistence on faulty tactics was devastating. Although they remained a potent and professional force  Hitler's effective ban on the future use of airborne forces lasted until 1943  when it was clear the Allies still very much considered paratroops a viable form of warfare. By then  Germany's ability to conduct airborne operations on a significant scale had long since passed.  <p>The German innovation of vertical envelopment in the 1930's was as revolutionary to modern military tactics as the simultaneous development of the integrated combined arms offensive known today as the Blitzkrieg. In putting Billy Mitchell's ideas into practice  Luftwaffe General Student demonstrated vision  innovative thinking and practical military skill. Poor intelligence and reliance on his ""spreading oil drops"" tactics for the deployment of his paratroopers  the Fallschirmtruppe  on Crete  however  led directly to their removal as a significant weapon from the German arsenal in World War II. Nevertheless  Student proved that airborne troops have unique capabilities as a force multiplier in both offensive and defensive warfare. The German experience  which also demonstrated the limitations of airborne forces  was studied in depth by the U.S. Army after the war and incorporated into airborne doctrine.  <p>",,,B&W 8.25 x 11 in or 280 x 210 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,60,,N,,20-May-10,9-Apr-10,20.99,15.99,25.99,18.99,27.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,20.99,,19.05,20.99,20.99,20.99,19.05,19.05,20.99,20.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

The disorder caused by the fractured and often changing strategy made it nearly impossible for subordinate commanders to establish priorities of effort and establish a synchronized operational concept. Consequently  the tactical commander  Freyberg  was unable to organize  equip and resource his defense properly.<p>Alied strategy was unsuccessful for two reasons. First  the development of Allied strategy resembled that of a pinball game rather than a deliberative  objectives-based process.  Rather than forcing the Germans into a predictable move  counter-move contest  the indecisive Allied strategy caused them to out-maneuver themselves resulting in available Allied combat power going unemployed. Second  an overall lack of unity of command plagued the implementation of strategies. Polliticians  the General Staff and subordinate commanders who disagreed with the strategy did their best to derail or not support it. Not only were the Allies strategically out-maneuvered due to these factors  but the consequences of these strategic errors were visited on operational and tactical units in dramatic fashion. The operational ommanders tasked to provide forces  equipment  resources and support to the effort considered Greece and eventually Crete economy of force operations and released resources without reducing their own capabilities.<p>The Allies failed to clearly define  articulate  and implement the strategic objectives of their entry into Greece. As a result  subordinate commanders were unable to create operational level unity of command and to synchronize their efforts to achieve the Allied objectives.

Inexperienced Allied forces were willing to fight  but the sentiment was the Germans were too powerful. Defeat became a foregone conclusion. To defend at all costs no longer appeared viable. Withdrawal and evacuation seemed almost commonplace in Allied strategy. Great Britain and Germany identified early in the war the strategic importance of the island of Crete for conducting military operations in the Mediterranean. Operationally the British maintained naval supremacy in the Mediterranean  while the German Luftwaffe ruled the skies. <p>The Allies began defending Crete in November 1940. However  the Middle East Command put little effort into defending the island and changed Crete Force Commanders on a monthly basis. Allied intelligence uncovered the details of the German invasion plan for Crete. In a last ditch effort  forces evacuated from Greece were sent to Crete to bolster the defenses. This brought the total number of Allied defenders to 42 500 to repel an estimated enemy assault of 5 000 men. <p>The German plan for the occupation of Crete  Operation MERCURY  called for gliders and Hitler's elite paratroops to conduct the largest airborne operation to date. The plan pitted 22 000 men and 1280 aircraft against an erroneously estimated enemy strength of 5 000 men. The success of this plan relied upon surprise and the paratroops securing one of the three airfields on the island so reinforcements could be flown in. <p>A reluctant Crete Force Commander set the tone for subordinate commanders' leadership failures. The invasion began the morning of 20 May 1941. The Germans suffered heavy casualties. At the end of the first day of fighting  they were short ammunition  and the Allies maintained control of the airfields. However  the battalion commander defending the airfield at Maleme  lacking communications and situational awareness  was unaware of the success of his unit and that night mistakenly ordered its withdrawal from the airfield. The Germans occupied the airfield in the morning and reinforcements were flown in. The Allies conducted an attack the night of 21 May to retake the airfield  but poor Allied leadership at the Brigade and Division level resulted in failure. Consequently  the Germans were able to mass combat power on the island and defeat the Allies.<p>The defenders outnumbered the attackers nearly 2 to 1  knew the invasion plan  and established their defense accordingly. By all accounts  the Allies should have defeated the Germans and in fact came quite close to doing so. However  failures in Allied leadership afforded the Germans opportunities that were quickly exploited. Subsequently  they were able to defeat the Allies within 12 days. Failure in Allied leadership  not overwhelming German combat power  was responsible for the Allied defeat on Crete.,,,B&W 8.25 x 11 in or 280 x 210 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,62,,N,,20-May-10,16-Apr-10,11.99,8.99,14.99,10.99,15.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,11.99,,11.05,11.99,11.99,11.99,11.05,11.05,11.99,11.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

Rather than being a part of a coherent strategy to defeat the Allies in the Mediterranean  this attack was merely an attempt for Hitler to shore up his southern flank before invading Russia. The author of the airborne plan  General Kurt Student  wanted to prove that airborne troops could be used operationally and drew up the plan to attack Crete with paratroopers and air landed elite mountain troops supported by seaborne reinforcements. Lacking proper resources to conduct the attack and with only three weeks to plan  Student developed a plan to attack the island at four widespread locations. He envisioned complete surprise and failed to make any contingency plans. The Allies defending Crete  having the benefit of intercepted German communications  were prepared for the attack  but lacked the necessary weapons and supplies to properly defend the island. Ten days later the Germans had captured the island  but at a cost of over 6 000 German troops and over 170 transport aircraft. <p>In Student's rush to prove to the Fuhrer the operational benefit of an airborne force  he ignored key principles of the offense and thus destroyed the very force he advocated.

(Norway, 1940; Falkland Islands, 1982)",9.78161E+12,1608880230,Available for Printing/Download,Perfect Bound,ENG,,,,0,"Buhl, Willard A.",,,Author,,,,,,HIS027150,HISTORY / Military / Naval,HIS027140,HISTORY / Military / Aviation & Space,HIS027100,HISTORY / Wars & Conflicts / World War II / General,Nimble Books LLC,,,,,,"Thesis: This essay examines the British use of sea-based aviation in support of two modern amphibious campaigns: the British campaign in Norway in 1940 and in the Falkland Islands War in 1982. The purpose is to determine whether or not aircraft carriers (sea-based aviation) were at the root of the success or failure of British efforts. <p>Discussion: In April 1940  there were no airfields in central Norway capable of supporting modern  high performance aircraft. As the Norwegian campaign unfolded and the British faced a significant land-based air threat from the Luftwaffe  they failed to appreciate the tactical and operational potential of sea-based aviation. At the same time  British naval aircraft were technically inferior in design and capability compared to their Luftwaffe land-based counterparts in 1940. Nevertheless  despite determined attacks on British naval assets at the tactical level  at the operational level  the German command limited their campaign goals and did not exploit their advantage in the air to the extent possible. Their actions did  however  place great pressure on British sea based lines of communication in central Norway  the operational pivot of the campaign. In 1982  against the Argentines  the British faced another opponent with superior land-based aviation. Although the British fully appreciated the need for air superiority  they employed a tactical scheme not unlike what had occurred in Norway. Nevertheless  the British were able to successfully contest the airspace above the Falklands and ultimately succeeded in defeating Argentine ground forces and ejecting them from the islands.<p> Conclusions: Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare (EMW) operations and sustainable littoral power projection will require versatile and flexible sea-based airpower. Much as the British expeditionary forces faced land-based airpower threats in Norway in 1940 and the Falkland Islands in 1982  U.S. aircraft carriers will be required to establish local air superiority over the fleet. Whereas land-based aircraft can attack fleets from great distances  current land-based fighters cannot protect the fleet from attack without extended aerial refueling. When air superiority cannot be maintained over the fleet  as evidenced in Norway and the Falklands  naval forces become prey to land-based airpower. Power projection from the sea occurs as a result of maintaining local air superiority  not in spite of it. Naval aviation exists to provide air superiority for naval fleets and sealift assets. Power projection from the sea is possible in large part because of air superiority. Until a space-based system capable of providing air superiority for ships at sea is fielded  ""legacy platforms"" such as aircraft carriers and their embarked air wings  despite their high cost  will remain essential naval warfare platforms. Further  however  and perhaps of greatest importance to this study  amphibious forces ashore cannot rely on aircraft carrier (sea-based) air support if a credible land-based aircraft or missile threat to supporting aircraft carriers exists.",,,B&W 8.25 x 11 in or 280 x 210 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,64,,N,,9-Apr-10,31-Mar-10,17.99,13.99,22.99,15.99,23.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,17.99,,16.55,17.99,17.99,17.99,16.55,16.55,17.99,17.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

THE LOST SYMBOL -- Found: Unauthorized Analysis of Dan Brown's Novel,9.78161E+12,1608880117,Available for Printing/Download,Perfect Bound,ENG,,,,0,"Davis, Graeme",,,Author,,,,,,LIT000000,LITERARY CRITICISM / General,,,,,Nimble Books LLC,,,,,,"From the Introduction:<p>The Lost Symbol contains a big surprise. Not only is the lost symbol found within the context of the novel  but according to Dan Brown this lost symbol is out there for every one of us to find for ourselves. This is a book which he wants to have real impact on our lives. For some readers it may even be life-changing-and that's not what we expect of a thriller.<p>Readers haven't known quite what to make of The Lost Symbol. Early reports-for example reader reviews on Amazon-have shown in roughly equal numbers reviews which are very positive and those which reveal the reader's disappointment or confusion. There seems to be a consensus of sorts that as a thriller this book is better than the average page-turner  but that it nonetheless has plot holes and shortcomings. For many it does not live up to expectations  though in view of the plot weaknesses of all previous Dan Brown books it is perhaps surprising that the expectations were so high.<p>Yet there is something about The Lost Symbol which lifts it from the status of just another fast-paced thriller to something which warrants consideration as a serious work of literature. For in this book the characters go in search of what is in effect a Holy Grail-the lost symbol-and in a break with the tradition of the genre they really do find the lost symbol. By the end of this book this symbol is not only found but is made available to every reader. It is a quest both for the characters and for the readers  and a quest where for both the goal is really reached. If you read The Lost Symbol you too can find the Lost Symbol-and perhaps it can change your life.<p>My view is that The Lost Symbol is no ordinary thriller  and those who seek to evaluate it solely as a thriller miss the point. Rather this is a book where we are invited to follow the hero Robert Langdon on a journey of personal development  a voyage into the mysteries of faith.<p>In this book l I offer some additional information and reflection aimed at following up on the quest set by Dan Brown  and perhaps helping a few more people find what Dan Brown is showing us. Taking The Lost Symbol section by section this book offers an exploration of Dan Brown's themes  his plot and characters  and explores some of the references in this work which Dan Brown calls ""fact-based fiction"". It looks also at his presentation of the Masons and how Dan Brown's own life influences his book. Most of all it looks towards finding the lost symbol  helping to unlock the potential of the novel and bring to the fore its message of hope for humanity.<p>",,,B&W 5.5 x 8.5 in or 216 x 140 mm (Demy 8vo) Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,144,,N,,23-Nov-09,19-Nov-09,17.99,13.99,21.99,15.99,22.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,17.99,,15.93,17.99,17.99,17.99,15.93,15.93,17.99,17.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

A cabal of generals took the nation's reins and bungled their way toward an accommodation with the Allies. When General Eisenhower announced an armistice with Italy on the evening of 8 September he believed he had struck a deal that included Italian military cooperation against the Germans. In fact  the generals had promised more than they could deliver and Germany's terrible  swift reprisal shattered Italy's confused air force and army. The armistice likewise caught the navy by surprise  with its battleships raising steam to attack the Allied fleet landing at Salerno. Nonetheless  the Regia Marina obeyed its government's orders and honored the pact the generals had negotiated. Rather than evaporating like Italy's other services  however  it proceeded to fight a three-week campaign against Germany  without Allied support  and in the process retained complete control of its ships  regardless of the ports necessity forced them to seek refuge in.<p> This is the story of the Regia Marina and the Italian armistice of September 1943. It is a deeply-researched and highly readable exploration of this confusing and fascinating corner of history. It refutes the conventional notion that Italy's fleet abjectly surrendered to Allied power. It shows how the navy paved Italy's path from enemy to co-belligerent with the blood and unconquered spirit of its men. Despite German and Allied intentions to secure Italy's fleet for their own uses  it remained Italian to the end: a dark navy - not victorious  but undefeated.<p> Vincent P. O'Hara and Enrico Cernuschi have collaborated for publications including <i>Warship  World War II Magazine  World War II Quarterly </i> and the new <i>Seaforth Naval Review</i>. Mr. O'Hara has written several books including <i>Struggle for the Middle Sea: the Great Navies at War in the Mediterranean 1939-1945</i> (Annapolis  2009).   Mr. Cernuschi is a regular contributor to Rivista Marittima and Storia Militare. He has published a dozen books including <i>Le navi da guerra italiane 1940-1945</i> (Parma  2003) and <i>Domenico Cavagnari: Storia di un Ammiraglio</i> (Rome  2001)<h2>About DARK NAVY</h2>The huge tragedy suffered by the Italian navy and nation has been reduced  until today  to a brief mention in the very few books available abroad about the Regia Marina's war between 1940 and 1945. It is thus quite important that a new essay directed toward English speaking readers is dedicated  at last  to these events  allowing them to sortie beyond the confines of Italian naval historiography--which has long debated these themes--and beyond the scanty circulation abroad of the Italian language.--Erminio Bagnasco  editor of STORIA Militare<p>DARK NAVY is a masterful account of the Regia Marina's role in the Armistice of September 1943. The authors are to be commended for overturning the propagandist mythology which has often marred English-language histories of this difficult period in Italian history. A riveting story.--John Jordan  editor of WARSHIP<p>DARK NAVY gives an excellent overview of the naval  air  and land impact on the Italian military at the time of the 8 September 1943 Armistice. It clearly shows the hesitancy of various leaders  on both sides  as they grappled with ""what to do?"" in this radically changed wartime environment and gives solid detail on the actions that resulted.--Jack Greene  author (with Alessandro Massigiani) of NAVAL WAR IN THE MEDITERRANEAN 1940-1943.<p>",,,Premium Color 8 x 10 in or 254 x 203 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,108,,N,,19-Nov-09,10-Nov-09,29.99,22.99,37.99,26.99,39.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,29.99,,27.63,29.99,29.99,29.99,27.63,27.63,29.99,29.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

THE LOST SYMBOL -- Found: Unauthorized Analysis of Dan Brown's Novel,9.78161E+12,1608880109,Available for Printing/Download,Perfect Bound,ENG,,,,0,"Davis, Graeme",,,Author,,,,,,FIC000000,FICTION / General,LIT000000,LITERARY CRITICISM / General,,,Nimble Books LLC,,,,,,"From the Introduction:<p>The Lost Symbol contains a big surprise. Not only is the lost symbol found within the context of the novel  but according to Dan Brown this lost symbol is out there for every one of us to find for ourselves. This is a book which he wants to have real impact on our lives. For some readers it may even be life-changing-and that's not what we expect of a thriller.<p>Readers haven't known quite what to make of The Lost Symbol. Early reports-for example reader reviews on Amazon-have shown in roughly equal numbers reviews which are very positive and those which reveal the reader's disappointment or confusion. There seems to be a consensus of sorts that as a thriller this book is better than the average page-turner  but that it nonetheless has plot holes and shortcomings. For many it does not live up to expectations  though in view of the plot weaknesses of all previous Dan Brown books it is perhaps surprising that the expectations were so high.<p>Yet there is something about The Lost Symbol which lifts it from the status of just another fast-paced thriller to something which warrants consideration as a serious work of literature. For in this book the characters go in search of what is in effect a Holy Grail-the lost symbol-and in a break with the tradition of the genre they really do find the lost symbol. By the end of this book this symbol is not only found but is made available to every reader. It is a quest both for the characters and for the readers  and a quest where for both the goal is really reached. If you read The Lost Symbol you too can find the Lost Symbol-and perhaps it can change your life. <p>My view is that The Lost Symbol is no ordinary thriller  and those who seek to evaluate it solely as a thriller miss the point. Rather this is a book where we are invited to follow the hero Robert Langdon on a journey of personal development  a voyage into the mysteries of faith. <p>In this book l I offer some additional information and reflection aimed at following up on the quest set by Dan Brown  and perhaps helping a few more people find what Dan Brown is showing us. Taking The Lost Symbol section by section this book offers an exploration of Dan Brown's themes  his plot and characters  and explores some of the references in this work which Dan Brown calls ""fact-based fiction"". It looks also at his presentation of the Masons and how Dan Brown's own life influences his book. Most of all it looks towards finding the lost symbol  helping to unlock the potential of the novel and bring to the fore its message of hope for humanity.<p>",,,B&W 5.5 x 8.5 in or 216 x 140 mm (Demy 8vo) Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,144,,N,,16-Nov-09,5-Nov-09,17.99,13.99,21.99,15.99,22.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,17.99,,,17.99,17.99,17.99,,15.93,17.99,17.99,30,,,30,30,30,,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,N,6024045,W.

W. Maitland:<p>When we consider that some five thousand pages of detailed findings  writtenabout a hundred years ago  have been modified in only a few minor emphasesand one or two facts  and that the bulk of Maitland's edifice still stands  we canbegin to understand why he has an almost god-like status among historians whoknow the problems he faced and the elegance of his solutions.<p>The great legal historian Vinogradoff disagreed with Maitland on some specificpoints  but shortly after Maitland's death wrote of him as 'the greatest legalhistorian of the law of England' and as a man to whom lawyers  historians andsociologists were equally indebted: 'lawyers because of his subject  historiansbecause of his methods  sociologists because of his results.'<p>J.H.Hexter referred to Maitland as 'the greatest of English historians' in hisbook on modern historians. R.G.Collingwood referred to the 'best historians like Mommsen and Maitland'. Denys Hay in his overview of westernhistoriography describes him as a 'giant' who  with Marc Bloch  is one of the 'twogreatest historians of recent times'. Bloch himself referred to 'the great Englishjurist Maitland.' The medievalist Helen Cam ends her preface to his SelectedEssays by concluding fifty years after his death. 'Let us say with Powicke ""Maitland is one of the immortals"" and leave it at that.' G.O.Sayles wrote that'In the range of his interests  the fineness of his intellect  and the considerablebulk of what he wrote in barely twenty-five years  Maitland has no match amongEnglish historians.' <p>Driven on by the sense of an impending early death Maitland tried to solvewithin a period of some twenty years the same riddle as earlier thinkers. Howhad the strange modern world  with its glimpses of liberty  equality and wealth been made? Why had it found its expression in a certain part of the world and inits earliest and definitive form in England? What precisely were the constituents of this peculiar civilization? His solutions  much more deeply based ondocuments  were in substance the same as those put forward by Montesquieu Adam Smith and Tocqueville. The essence of modernity lay in the separation ofspheres  the tensions between religion  politics  kinship and economy. Out ofthese contradictions emerged certain liberties and a dynamic energy.<p> A whole set of factors  from the general (the nature of islandhood  theaccident of the Norman Conquest  the absence of Cathar heresies and theinquisition)  to the individual (the personality of Henry II or Edward I) playedtheir part. What happened on one small island both reflected what happened onits neighbouring continent  but also transformed it. Like some new species offinch on the Galapagos  there developed a new kind of civilization. This wouldthen be magnified and taken to its extreme through other accidents  thedevelopment of America  the expansion of the British Empire and the firstindustrial revolution and so to the modern world. With Maitland we have adeveloped theory which puts forward a believable answer to one part of thequestion of how the modern world has been made.<p>",,,Premium Color 7 x 10 in or 254 x 178 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,106,,N,,1-Sep-09,25-Aug-09,24.99,18.99,30.99,22.99,32.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,24.99,,22.84,24.99,24.99,24.99,22.84,22.84,24.99,24.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

I argued then that in a context of re-medievalization - the world fragmented into ""stans"" - we are now living an intestinal war  an undeclared global civil war. Borrowing from Zygmunt Bauman's concept of liquid modernity  I called it Liquid War - and not only because of the global scramble for ""black gold"" oil and ""blue gold"" gas. <p>Globalistan was essentially a long reportage crisscrossing the world. This text reflects the fact that I spent most of 2008 in the U.S. following the presidential campaign. As far as New Rome is concerned I'm usually outside looking in - the point of view of my dying profession  the foreign correspondent. In this text I'm most of the time inside looking out. Globalistan can be read as an on the ground - and underground - report on the Bush administration wasteland. This text could be something of a last chapter - out of the belly of the beast.<p>     2009 is the Mother of all celebratory years. The 20 years of the fall of the Berlin Wall.

Only underwater robots lagged: so far just a few dozen systems have entered service. Under the water is  after all  the toughest environment for robots. But even undersea bots will see a boost in coming years. The Pentagon has plans to spend at least $4 billion a year for the foreseeable future designing and building robots.<p>The spread of robots in our armies  navies and air forces has greatly advanced the science  engineering and techniques for mixing thinking people and thinking machines. And it has forced us to try answering a basic moral question. Just how much responsibility should we surrender to machines? If and when robots fulfill their promise to make war cheaper and easier for our side  will we discover that we wage war too lightly? Are we already guilty of that sin?<p>This book examines just a handful of the many types of war bots  and just a few of the ways they're being used in the expanding American-led ""war on terror.""

It won't be asking you questions like ""what school did Harry Potter go to?"" (If you are a Harry Potter fan  then of course you know the answer!) Rather it asks questions which will develop your literary appreciation of the Harry Potter books and your general knowledge of the Harry Potter phenomenon. Some of these questions are easy  quite a few are fiendishly difficult  and several of them really don't have simple answers  but thinking about possible answers is what it is all about. Work through this quiz book (with an eye on the answers) and come out the other end with a much better understanding of the phenomenon that is Harry Potter. After each question  space is provided in which you may jot down your preliminary answer. <p>In this quiz book there is a focus on the language used by J. K. Rowling. From alchemy to whomping via such gems as hallows and knickerbockers the books use a range of words which are not part of the everyday word stock of most speakers of English  and certainly not of most children. True fans of the Harry Potter series will want to know them! There is a mass of information around the world of Harry Potter  some of it trivia (but fun!)  some key to our appreciation of the books. Also fans have realized that the books have some serious points to make. No book achieves anything approaching the success of the Harry Potter series unless it includes something that makes us all think. This Harry Potter Quiz Book aims to draw your attention to some of these big questions. Knowing the name of Harry Potter's school is not likely to change the life of any one of us  but thinking about the moral issues raised in the books might do just that.<p>",,,B&W 5.5 x 8.5 in or 216 x 140 mm (Demy 8vo) Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,76,,N,,15-Jun-08,11-Jun-08,20.51,10,,17,,20,20,,20,,No,No,,No,,20.51,,20.51,,,,,20.51,20.51,,20,,20,,,,,20,20,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

It shows how globalization is not proceeding according to the myth of &quot;everyone profits&quot;: instead  it is fragmenting the world into even more explosive inequality  into &quot;stans&quot; - some stans configured as fortresses  some stans at war with others. Energy wars  and the multiple intersections of globalization and war  only increase the polarization. Globalistan argues that the world is being dissolved into Liquid War - a natural consequence of &quot;liquid modernity &quot; a concept formulated by Polish sociologist Zygmunt Bauman. The book is 80% based on reportage - from China to Central Asia and Russia; before  during and after the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq; in Iran and in the Middle East; in Western Europe  Western Africa and South America.

"No-Fly Zones:Strategic, Operational, and Legal Considerations for Congress",9.78161E+12,1608881245,Title has expired,Perfect Bound,ENG,,,,0,"Congressional Research Service,",,,Author,,,,,,LAW018000,LAW / Constitutional,HIS026000,HISTORY / Middle East / General,HIS027140,HISTORY / Military / Aviation & Space,Nimble Books LLC,,,,,,"Congressional Research Service Report issued March 18  2011.<p>The ongoing uprising in Libya against the government of Muammar al Qadhafi has been the subject of ongoing domestic and international debate about potential international military intervention  including the proposed establishment of a no-fly zone over Libya. Congress may wish to consider issues surrounding the strategy  international authorization  congressional authorization  operations  and costs of establishing and maintaining no-fly zones. <p>The military strategy designed to support the grand strategy  it has been suggested  might be based on these considerations: the operational-level military objectives that need to be achieved  to support the overall grand strategy; and the extent to which a no-fly zone-as one set of ways and means-helps achieve those objectives. <p>Practitioners and observers have debated what constitutes international ""authorization"" for the establishment of a no-fly zone. Given the paucity of relevant precedents  and the dissimilarities among them  there may not exist a single  clear  agreed model. The concept of authorization is typically considered to be linked to the ideas of both ""legality"" and ""legitimacy""-the three concepts overlap but are all distinct. The precise meaning of each of the terms is still debated. Express authorization from the U.N. Security Council provides the clearest legal basis for imposing a no-fly zone. <p>In addition to international authorization  debates have addressed the question of congressional authorization-whether and when there is a need for congressional approval based on the War Powers Resolution for a proposed no-fly zone. The question of whether and how congressional authorization is sought for a proposed operation could have an impact on congressional support- including policy  funding  and outreach to the American people-for the operation. Since the War Powers Resolution gives the President the authority to launch U.S. military actions prior to receiving an authorization from Congress for 60-90 days  it is possible that the President could direct U.S. Armed Forces to take or support military actions in accordance with U.N. Security Council resolutions  or in support of NATO operations  and then seek statutory authority for such actions from Congress. <p>No-fly zone operations can conceivably take a number of different forms  and can themselves vary a great deal over time. Key considerations include  but are not limited to  the following factors: the nature  density  quantity  and quality of adversary air assets; geography; the availability of ""friendly"" assets; the adversary's military capabilities and responses; the U.S. military's concept of operations  and the rules of engagement. <p>The costs of establishing and maintaining a no-fly zone are likely to vary widely based on several key parameters. They could be the specific military tasks that a given no-fly zone operation calls for  the geography of the adversary's country  the duration of the no-fly zone  the extent to which the U.S. is joined by international partners in the effort  and the extent of ""mission creep""-how  if at all  the operation expands to include a broader array of activities designed to achieve the same military and strategic objectives. <p>",,,Premium Color 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,24,,N,,31-Mar-01,22-Apr-11,17.13,11,18,15,18,20,25,20,20,20,No,No,No,No,No,17.13,,17.13,,,,,17.13,17.13,,20,,20,,,,,20,20,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.
