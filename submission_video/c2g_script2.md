0:01 Welcome to Codexes2Gemini, a project that brings togethr the world of book-lovers with Google's Gemini AI API.

0:07 The source is available on GitHub and via pip install.

0:22 You can upload text, docx, and PDF to persistent userspace.

0:38 Let's zoom out to the big picture. Gutenberg, like AI, wan "adaptive event" for book publishing. A huge impetus to
innovation in form & function.

1:00 The modern book embodies 500 years of usability learning by publishers, authors and designers.

1:08 Prompt dictionaries translate this accumulated wisdom into Gemini input and output.

Long context windows will trigger a rapid increase of speciation and taxonomic diversity in book publishing: a Cambrian
Explosion.

The history of book publishing rhymes with the history of life.

- Simple organisms: the cell, the word.
- The first large organisms: Edicararean rangeomorophs, primitive codexes.
- An explosion of morphological and structural diversity: Cambrian period, codexes.
- A giant asteroid hits Earth: many phyla disappear, new ones abound (Gutenberg).
- A new evolutionary radiation: the interior form, function, ad structure evolve rapidly.
    - Mammals!
    - New parts of the book abound: busy title pages, multi-page dedications, elaborate indexes and more.
- Consolidation and rationalization occurs - a mixed blessing. .
    - Goodbye charismatic megafauna!
    - Goodbye multipage dedications, elaborate footnotes, multiple indexes, foldout maps.
- The Internet & ebooks:
    - Changes the environment, but not as badly as feared. Printed books survive, new titles abound, e-books find their
      niche.
- Long input and output context windows are the next asteroid that will strike book publishing.

This is a good place for The Big Idea: very long context input and output is an *adaptive event* for the world of books,
something that changes everything and triggers a radiation of shape, structure, function, and style.

The history of publishing rhymes with the history of life.

Next: early creatures and early codexes.
