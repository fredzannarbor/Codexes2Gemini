# Who's Who of Villains.

| Villain | Description |
|---|---|
| The Left | A nebulous but pervasive force within American politics and society who are pushing for a large and activist federal government, the redistribution of wealth, and the destruction of traditional American values.  The Left is also responsible for the rise of "wokeism" in American institutions, the media, and culture.  The Left is often characterized as promoting the principles of "cultural Marxism" or "cultural socialism." |
| "Experts" |  A group of unelected experts who believe that they have the knowledge and authority to tell Americans how to live their lives.  Experts are not typically subject to the same constraints as elected officials or government employees, and they often are able to influence policy by taking advantage of their expertise and status. |
|  "Elite" | A group of wealthy and powerful individuals who often are hostile to the ideals of individual liberty, limited government, and free markets. Elites typically are found in major corporations, public institutions, the media, and academia. |
|  "Woke Culture Warriors" |  Leftist activists who have embedded themselves within nearly every American institution with the purpose of destroying American values and culture.  They promote policies that are designed to undermine the traditional values of American society, including racism, gender ideology, and abortion, often in the name of "social justice" or "equity." |
|  "Diversicrats" |  A term coined by author Chris Rufo to describe those who promote policies based on identity politics, who are anti-meritocratic, and who seek to divide American society based on immutable characteristics rather than merit. | 
| Global Elites |  A group of individuals who are working to undermine the sovereignty of nations by promoting supranational institutions and agreements, such as the United Nations, World Trade Organization, and World Health Organization.   Global elites typically are found in international organizations, government ministries, and corporations.  |
|  "Big Tech" | Large, often internet-based companies with enormous market power and influence over the information and access people have.  These firms often seek to profit by using their market power to stifle the spread of unpopular or controversial viewpoints.  They may also be engaged in data collection and information harvesting. |
|  The Aid Industrial Complex |   A network of international nongovernmental organizations, for-profit companies, and government agencies that are working to maintain and expand the practice of foreign aid to the developing world. The aid industry is seen as often self-serving and unaccountable, and it may not always deliver the results it promises. |
